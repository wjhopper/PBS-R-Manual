# Statistics

```{r stats_setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.align = "center")
# Load libraries
library(psych)
defaults <- par(mar = c(4,4,1,1), no.readonly = TRUE)
```

## The Data

We rely on the `sat.act` data set from the `psych` package for all demonstrations in this chapter. 

To make the data set available on your own computer, run the following code:

```{r load_psych, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('psych')
library(psych)
```

You should now be able to access the `sat.act` data set:

```{r access sat.act}
summary(sat.act)
```

As you can see, this data set includes self-reported SAT and ACT scores along with demographic information from 700 respondents. It therefore contains both categorical and continuous variables that are appropriate for both within- and between-subjects analyses. For more information, refer to the help documentation by running the command `?sat.act`.

## Formula Objects

Formulas are special objects in R that are used in a range of functions discussed in this chapter, notably `plot()`, `aov()`, and `lm()`. The use of formulas in these specific functions will be discussed in more detail below, but we first introduce their general properties here. 

The basic structure is as follows:

```y ~ x```

The `y` variable is the dependent variable, the `x` variable is the independent variable, and the `~` operator can be taken to mean "as a function of". Thus, the above example is a formula for "y as a function of x".

For a more concrete example, consider the effect of the independent variable age on the dependent variable ACT scores:

```sat.act$ACT ~ sat.act$age```

We can have multiple independent variables in the formula. For instance, if we wanted to define ACT scores as a function of age and education, we would do so as follows:

```sat.act$ACT ~ sat.act$age + sat.act$education```

The above formula is an example of an "additive" model, in which ACT scores are a function of the additive effects of age and education. To define the interactive model, we would separate age and education by an asterisk instead of a plus sign:

```sat.act$ACT ~ sat.act$age*sat.act$education```

Note that the above formula defines the *full* interactive model, so ACT scores are defined as a function of (1) the main effect of age, (2) the main effect of education, and (3) the interaction of age and education. This same model can be implemented by defining each component separately in the formula object, like this:

```sat.act$ACT ~ sat.act$age + sat.act$education + sat.act$age:sat.act$education```

By defining the components separately, you can pick and choose which to keep. For instance, you could specify only the main effect of age and the interaction of age and education, as follows:

```sat.act$ACT ~ sat.act$age + sat.act$age:sat.act$education```

Formulas can get much more complex than the examples here, which only extend as far necessary for the functions and tests that you are likely to use as an instructor in undergraduate psychology program. A comprehensive tutorial can be found [here](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/r-formula-tutorial). 

## Descriptive Statistics

### Handling `NA` Values

Missing data are coded as `NA` in R. Several functions include arguments that allow for `NA` values to be removed before any calculations are done by setting the `na.rm` argument to `TRUE`. For instance, when we try to take the mean of the quantitative SAT scores in the `sat.act` data set without removing `NA` values, we get `NA` as the output:

```{r mean NA}
mean(sat.act$SATQ)
```

But by setting `na.rm=TRUE`, we get a sensible answer:

```{r mean NA remove}
mean(sat.act$SATQ, na.rm=TRUE)
```

In addition to the `mean()` function, the `median()`, `var()`, and `sd()` functions take the `na.rm` argument. To see whether other functions not discussed take this argument, consult the help page for that particular function.

Note that `NA` values cannot always be easily removed when calculating descriptive statistics by hand. For instance, in the case of the mean (demonstrated below), while the `sum()` function will take the `na.rm` argument, the `length()` function will not. Thus, if you plan to ask students to calculate the mean by hand in R, be sure to choose a method of removing `NA` values manually. You can either remove the values yourself beforehand, give the students code to do it, or teach them to look out for and handle `NA` values themselves.

### Mean

To calculate the mean of a vector by hand, use the `sum()` and `length()` functions. For instance, we can calculate the mean verbal SAT score in the `sat.act` data set as follows:

```{r mean hand}
sum(sat.act$SATV)/length(sat.act$SATV)
```

We can also get the same answer by using the `mean()` function:

```{r mean fun}
mean(sat.act$SATV)
```

### Median

You can ask students to calculate the median of a vector by hand by having them index the output of the `sort()` function. To demonstrate, imagine that we want to know the median age of respondents in the `sat.act` data set. Calling `sort()` function on the `age` variable will take all of the respondents' ages and put them in ascending order:

```{r sort}
sort(sat.act$age)
```

We can then find the median by indexing the middle value of the sorted vector. If the vector has an odd number of values, this is simply half of the length of the vector plus .5:

```{r sort index odd, eval=FALSE}
sort(sat.act$age)[(length(sat.act$age)/2)+.5]
```

Of course, there are 700 respondents in the `sat.act` data set, so the above command is not appropriate. When the vector has an even number of values like ours, the median is calculated as the average of the two middle values:

```{r sort index even}

# Find the two middle values
middle_vals <- sort(sat.act$age)[(length(sat.act$age)/2):((length(sat.act$age)/2)+1)]

# Take the mean of the two middle values
mean(middle_vals)

```

Any `NA` values are automatically removed when calculating the median by hand using the `sort()` function, however you can also choose to have missing values placed last or first in the output by setting the `na.last` argument to 'TRUE' or 'FALSE', respectively. 

Note, of course, that you might also allow students to simply print the output of `sort()` and find the median visually.

We can also get the same answer by using the `median()` function:

```{r median fun}
median(sat.act$age)
```

### Variance

Calculating the variance by hand requires more distinct sequencing than for the mean and the median. To demonstrate, imagine that we want to find the variance of the verbal SAT scores reported in the `sat.act` data set.

Recall from your knowledge of statistics that the formula for the variance of a sample is:

$$s^2=\frac{\sum (x_i-\bar{x})^2}{n-1}$$

You might first have students find the squared difference between each value and the mean:

```{r var squared diff}
SATV_sq_diff <- (sat.act$SATV-mean(sat.act$SATV))^2
```

You can then have students sum up these squared deviations and divide by the total number, minus one:

```{r var sum & divide}
sum(SATV_sq_diff)/(length(SATV_sq_diff)-1)
```

We can also get the same answer by using the `var()` function:

```{r var fun}
var(sat.act$SATV)
```

### Standard Deviation

To calculate the standard deviation by hand, simply extend the previous commands for calculating the variance one step further by calling `sqrt()` on the previous result:

```{r sd hand}

# Find the squared deviations
SATV_sq_diff <- (sat.act$SATV-mean(sat.act$SATV))^2

# Sum squared deviations and divide by n-1
SATV_var <- sum(SATV_sq_diff)/(length(SATV_sq_diff)-1)

# Take the square root
sqrt(SATV_var)

```

More simply, students could take the square root of the output of `var()`:

```{r sd hand var}
sqrt(var(sat.act$SATV))
```

Note that the square root of a value can also be found by raising it to .5:

```{r sd hand exp}
var(sat.act$SATV)^.5
```

We can also get the same answer by using the `sd()` function:

```{r sd fun}
sd(sat.act$SATV)
```

### Standard Error of the Mean

To calculate the standard error of the mean, simply extend the previous commands for calculating the standard deviation one step further by dividing the previous result by the number of observations minus one:

```{r sem hand}

# Find the squared deviations
SATV_sq_diff <- (sat.act$SATV-mean(sat.act$SATV))^2

# Sum squared deviations and divide by n-1
SATV_var <- sum(SATV_sq_diff)/(length(SATV_sq_diff)-1)

# Take the square root
SATV_sd <- sqrt(SATV_var)

# Divide by n-1
SATV_sd/(length(SATV_sq_diff)-1)

```

More simply, students could take divide the output of `sd()` by the number of observations minus one:

```{r sem hand sd}
sd(sat.act$SATV)/(length(sat.act$SATV)-1)
```

Because there are different methods for calculating the standard error depending on the nature of the sample statistic, there is no central function for calculating the standard error in R. The `std.error()` function is available in the package `plotrix` and handily includes the `na.rm` argument. However, if `NA` values aren't an issue, you may find that calculating the standard error is a simple enough extension of the standard deviation to have students do it by hand.

### Correlation & Proportion of Variance Explained

We do not recommend having students calculate Pearson's $r$ by hand. Instead, the correlation coefficient can be found using the `cor()` function. 

To demonstrate, imagine that we are curious as to whether there is a linear relationship between respondents' verbal and quantitative SAT scores:

```{r cor example}
cor(sat.act$SATV, sat.act$SATQ)
```

We immediately note that the output is `NA` because there are missing values in the quantitative SAT scores. To remedy this, set the `use` argument to  `complete.obs`:

```{r cor complete}
cor(sat.act$SATV, sat.act$SATQ, use='complete.obs')
```

With this method, `cor()` will remove any pairs containing at least one missing value before calculating the correlation coefficient.

To calculate the proportion of variance explained, $R^2$, simply square the correlation coefficient:

```{r r-squared}
cor(sat.act$SATV, sat.act$SATQ, use='complete.obs')^2
```

This is a handy way of demonstrating that $R^2$ is very simply $r$, squared.

### Summary Functions

The standard method for summarizing data with multiple descriptive statistics at once is to use the `summary()` function. This function can be used to simultaneously summarize each variable in a data set, such as those in the `iris` data frame:

```{r summarize example}
summary(iris)
```

Numeric variables are summarized with the minimum and maximum values, the .25, .5, and .75 quantile cutoff values, and the mean value. Factors are summarized with a table of counts for each factor level. Character strings are summarized in terms of their total length. 

A related function that is sometimes helpful is the `str()` function, which summarizes an object in terms of its class and the class of each of its elements:

```{r str example}
str(iris)
```

While it can be inferred from the output of `summary()` that `Species` is a factor and the remaining variables are numeric, `str()` makes this explicit.

Note that additional techniques exist for summarizing data with multiple descriptive statistics. The `describe()` function in the `psych` package provides a range of useful statistics for numeric variables. Tools provided in the `dplyr` package, particularly the combination of `group_by()` and `summarize()`, allow the user to specify their own descriptive statistics. 

## Plotting

One of the most compelling reason to learn and use R is because it includes highly flexible and powerful tools for visualizing many kinds of data. After all, if a single tool can perform your analyses and create your figures, why not use the "one ring to rule them all"?

Many visualizations can be created using the `plot()` function, so we'll begin our introduction using that function. As you'll soon see, the `plot()` function accepts many arguments, as there are many ways to customize a plot. Many of the other visualization tools in R accept similar arguments. So, if `plot()` accepts an argument, there is a fair chance another function will accept it as well.

### Scatter & Line Plots
If you have two vectors representing pairs of observations, you can plot them against one another in a scatter plot using the `plot()` function. Let's demonstrate this by plotting the SAT Verbal and SAT Quantitative scores from the `sat.act` dataset against one another.

```{r basicplot}
plot(sat.act$SATV, sat.act$SATQ) # Access the columns as vectors using $ syntax
```

The points in the plot above represent pairs SAT Verbal and SAT Quantitative scores. The scores in each vector are paired up by position within each vector - the first value in `SATV` is paired with the first value in `SATQ`, the second value in `SATV` is paired with the second value in `SATQ`, etc. The vector given as the first argument determines the X axis position, and the vector given as the second argument determines the Y axis position.

The axis titles are determined by the variable names of the vectors supplied to the `plot` function. However, variable names aren't always the most informative names for other humans to read. We can customize the axes and plot with informative titles using the `xlab`, `ylab` and `main` arguments for the `plot` function:

```{r axeslabels}
plot(sat.act$SATV, sat.act$SATQ,
     xlab = "SAT Verbal", ylab = "SAT Quantitative",
     main = "Relationship between SAT Scores")
```

#### Linetypes, Symbols, and Colors {-}
You can customize the scatterplot to draw lines between the points, or just draw lines without the point symbols with the `type` argument. **This is not a sensible thing to do for these data**, but we demonstrate it anyway for completeness.

```{r lines, fig.cap=c("Points and lines with type='o'", "Just using lines with type='l'")}
# Lines and points
plot(sat.act$SATV, sat.act$SATQ,
     xlab = "SAT Verbal", ylab = "SAT Quantitative",
     main = "Relationship between SAT Scores",
     type = "o")

# Just lines
plot(sat.act$SATV, sat.act$SATQ,
     xlab = "SAT Verbal", ylab = "SAT Quantitative",
     main = "Relationship between SAT Scores",
     type = "l")
```

You can also customize the types of symbols that are used for each point using the `pch`, the style of lines connecting these points using the `lty` argument, and the `col` argument to adjust the color of lines and symbol borders

With the `pch` argument, you specify the symbol used for each point using a numeric code. For example, the value `0` is the code for an unfilled square, while the value `15` is the value for a filled square with no border. Unfortunately, it has been scientifically proven that remembering the code for all the possible symbols is impossible. Luckily, a helpful mnemonic device called a "chart" has been invented to help R programmers customize their plots. This chart is shown below:

![](images/pch.png)

Note that if you supply a character instead of a numeric values between 0 and 25, R will use that character as the plotting symbol. So, you could make a plot full of pound signs if you are so inclined!

The `lty` argument has a bit more flexibility. Line types can either be specified as an integer (0=blank, 1=solid (default), 2=dashed, 3=dotted, 4=dotdash, 5=longdash, 6=twodash) or as one of the character strings "blank", "solid", "dashed", "dotted", "dotdash", "longdash", or "twodash".

The `col` argument accepts character strings describing either a "built in" color name (see `?colors` for a list) or an RGB triplet encoded in hexadecimal notation. Unless you are intimately familiar with RGB color space, it's a good idea to use a tool like the [W3 Organizations Online Color Picker](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp) to help you figure out the RGB hex code for the color you want.

To demonstrate, lets take our original plot (with no lines) and customize it to use unfilled, magenta triangles:
```{r pch_and_col}
# Lines and points
plot(sat.act$SATV, sat.act$SATQ,
     xlab = "SAT Verbal", ylab = "SAT Quantitative",
     main = "Relationship between SAT Scores",
     col="magenta", pch=2)
```

#### Axis limits {-}
R usually does a good job of determining good values for the range of each axis, but if you wish to override the defaults, you can do do using the `xlim` and `ylim` arguments. These arguments accepts 2-element numeric vectors specifying the minimum and maximum values along each axis (in that order). For example, if we wanted to include 0 in the range of SAT scores shown on the plot, we could use `c(0, 800)` for both our axis limits:

```{r limits}
# Lines and points
plot(sat.act$SATV, sat.act$SATQ,
     xlab = "SAT Verbal", ylab = "SAT Quantitative",
     main = "Relationship between SAT Scores",
     xlim = c(0, 800),
     ylim=c(0, 800))
```

This isn't particularly sensible, because 0 is not a possible score on the SAT, so consider this just a demonstration of R's capabilities.

#### Adding to an existing plot {-}
In many cases, it is useful to have *different* symbols, colors, and linetypes on the same plot - for example, to denote observations from different groups. There is more than one way to achieve this effect, but when you want different symbols, colors, and linetypes on the same plot, often the easiest way to do it is plot each group one at a time.

To do this, you begin with the familiar plot command, but use it to plot only a subset of the data. Then, you can use the `points` or `lines` function to add additional points (or lines) to the plot. We'll demonstrate how you can plot the SAT scores for males and females in different colors by subsetting the dataset, and then using the `plot` and `points` functions:

```{r}
males <- sat.act[sat.act$gender == 1, ]
females <- sat.act[sat.act$gender == 2, ]
plot(males$SATV, males$SATQ,
     xlab = "SAT Verbal", ylab = "SAT Quantitative",
     main = "Relationship between SAT Scores",
     col="red")
points(females$SATV, females$SATQ, col="blue")
```

#### Adding a legend {-}
If you use multiple symbols, colors, and linetypes on the same plot, you'll also need a legend telling the viewer how to interpret the different symbols, colors, and linetypes. You can add legends to an existing plot using the `legend` function. Unfortunately, the `legend` function doesn't know what symbols, colors, and linetypes you've used, or what the different groups in your data are. So, you'll have to re-capitulate this information to the legend function. Make *absolutely* sure that you specify the labels, colors, symbol codes, and linetypes in the exact same order you added them to the plot! You also must specify a `pch` or `linetype` value, even if you used the default value in your plot!

Perhaps the trickiest part about using the legend function is figuring out where to place the legend. The location may also be specified by setting the first argument to the legend function to a single keyword from the set "bottomright", "bottom", "bottomleft", "left", "topleft", "top", "topright", "right" or "center". Alternatively, you can get fine-grained control over the placement by providing two values that represent an x,y coordinate for the top-right corner of the legend:
```{r}
plot(males$SATV, males$SATQ,
     xlab = "SAT Verbal", ylab = "SAT Quantitative",
     main = "Relationship between SAT Scores",
     col="red")
points(females$SATV, females$SATQ, col="blue")
legend(x=200, y=800,
       legend = c("Males", "Females"),
       col = c("red", "blue"),
       pch=1)
```

#### Adding a regression line {-}
It is often useful to summarize the linear relationship between variables shown in a scatterplot. It is easy to add the "line of best fit" from a linear regression to your scatter plot using the `lm` function (short for "linear model) and the `abline` function (used for drawing straight lines).

The `lm` function performs regression analysis based on the [formula](#formula-objects) you specify. If you intend on adding the regression line to your scatterplot, we recommend you use the formula interface to the `plot()` function. Instead of using an `x` vector and a `y` vector, you can provide a formula of the form `y ~ x`, and the name of the data frame containing your vaiable, just like when using the `lm` function.
In this case, you would use the same formula to specify your plot that you use to specify your regression model. Remember of course, that the response variable (i.e., the y variable) goes first in the formula, not second as it would if you were providing two separate vectors.

To summarise, the basic steps are:

1. Perform your linear regression with `lm`, and save the output to a variable
2. Create your scatterplot using the same formula specification as in your linear model from Step 1.
3. Provide the `lm` object you saved in Step #1 to the `abline` function
4. Marvel at your wonderful new plot

```{r abline plot}
regression_results <- lm(SATQ ~ SATV, data=sat.act)
plot(SATQ ~ SATV, data=sat.act,
     xlab = "SAT Verbal", ylab = "SAT Quantitative",
     main = "Relationship between SAT Scores")
abline(regression_results, lwd=2) # lwd = "line width",
```

In the call to `abline` above, we have specified the `lwd` argument, short for "line width", a.k.a. thickness. The default value is 1, and we have double the thickness here so the regression line stands out from the points more.

### Histograms
You can create a histogram showing the counts or proportion of values from a single variable using the `hist` function. 

The `hist` function works with a vector of numeric values, and breaks this vector up into a number of discrete bins. By default, the `hist` function decides what the boundary values of the bins should be, and how many bins should be used, by applying the [Sturges algorithm](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/grDevices/html/nclass.html). However, you can manually control where the boundaries are placed by providing a vector of boundary values, or by providing a single value specifying the number of bins that should be used. We demonstrate both techniques below in plotting a histogram of ACT scores:

```{r hist}
hist(sat.act$ACT, breaks = 30)
bin_boundaries <- seq(0, max(sat.act$ACT), by=2) # from 0 to 36 by 2's
hist(sat.act$ACT, breaks = bin_boundaries)
```

If you want proportions instead of counts, set the `freq` argument to false. You can also use the same `xlab`, `ylab`, and `main` arguments we used with `plot` to get more informative titles/
```{r}
hist(sat.act$ACT, breaks = 30, freq=FALSE,
     main = "Distribution of ACT Scores",
     xlab = "ACT Score")
```


### Boxplots
Box plots are a good way to present the shape of distribution of samples from several groups, along with some summary statistics of each group. We can create these plots in R using the `boxplot` function.

If your to-be-plotted data is in a data frame, the best way to instruct the `boxplot` function what variables should be plotted is using a [formula](#formula-objects). If they are not in a data frame, you can provide each to-be-plotted variable as a separate vector. Here, we'll demonstrate the formula interface by plotting the SAT Verbal scores for respondents with education levels. Remember, when using the formula interface, you also have to tell the `boxplot` function what data frame to look for the variables in!

```{r boxplot, fig.width=9}
boxplot(SATV ~ education, data=sat.act,
        names=c("< High School", "High School", "Some College",
                "2 Yr. College", "4 Yr. College", "Grad. Work"),
        ylab="SAT Verbal Score", xlab="Education")
```

Note the use of the `names` argument to override the labels on each X axis point. Depending on how long the names of each variable are, some variable names might be ommitted from the axis labels, in order to prevent having overlapping characters obscuring the names. This can usually be be remedied by re-sizing the plot window to be larger, so that all the names can fit in. 

### Bar plots
Bar plots are used to visualize single summary statistics, like the mean or median across groups. We can create a bar plot in R using the `barplot` function. We'll demonstrate this by plotting the mean SAT Verbal score for males and females. The to-be-plotted value should be specified in a vector or matrix, with one element for each bar you want plotted

```{r barplot}
SATV_means <- c(mean(sat.act$SATV[sat.act$gender==1]),
                mean(sat.act$SATV[sat.act$gender==2])
                )
names(SATV_means) <- c("Males","Females")
barplot(SATV_means,
        ylim=c(0,800), ylab="Average SAT Verbal Score",
        main="SAT Verbal Scores for Males & Females"
        )
```

### Multiple plots in single figure
In many situations, it is useful to have several different plots in a single figure to facilitate comparison. But in the examples we have encountered so far, each time we create a new plot, it has removed the existing one from out figure window. We can change this behavior to allow multiple figures within the same window by using the `par` function, which changes R's global graphics parameters.

We can set the number of plots that go into a figure window much in the same way we set the dimensions of a matrix - by specifying how many rows of plots there can be, and how many columns of plots there can be. The product of these two values determines the number of plots that are put on a single figure window.

There are two global graphics parameters that allow us to set these dimensions - the `mfrow` parameter, and the `mfcol` parameter. The `mf` stands for "multiple figures", and the `row` or `col` part means the figures are filled in by rows, or by columns. Here, we demonstrate how to use the `mfrow` option to create a 2 by 2 grid of plots, which will allow us to compare the distribution of ACT scores in histograms with different numbers of breaks:

```{r par_mfrow}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
hist(sat.act$ACT, breaks = 10, main = "10 breaks")
hist(sat.act$ACT, breaks = 30, main = "30 breaks")
hist(sat.act$ACT, breaks = 50, main = "50 breaks")
hist(sat.act$ACT, breaks = 100, main = "100 breaks")
par(mfrow = c(1,1)) # Reset back to default
```
Always make sure to set your `mfrow` or `mfcol` values back to `c(1,1)` afterwards, or *all* subsequent plots will use the same layout!

### Saving Plots
Usually the purpose of creating a visualization in R is to include it in some kind of homework, report, or paper. It is easy to save a plot made in R to an image file on your hard drive using the "Export" option in the R Studio plot pane. Simply click the "Export" drop down menu, and select either the "Save to Image", "Save to PDF" or "Copy to Clipboard" options.

![](images/export_plot.png)

If you choose the "Save as Image" option, you'll get to choose which image format you want to save it as, and what the width and height (in pixels) the image should be saved as.

### What about ggplot?
The [ggplot2 package](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggplot2/versions/3.1.1) is an extremely popular visualization tool, which provides an alternative to the so-called "base graphics" functions described here. The popularity ggplot has achieved is well deserved - its visualizations are attractive, and its data-driven, modular coding style is very powerful. The programming style of ggplot is *very* different from the base graphics style. Perhaps the best way to summarize the ggplot approach is that it is builds on top of the organization of the observations inside a data frame and allows you to "map" the variables in your data frame to the "aesthetics" in a plot (shape, position, color, size, etc.).

We will not cover ggplot here, because it is not a necessity for 240 and 241 (though, in our opinion, a proficient R programmer should know how both ggplot *and* base graphics). However, we will re-iterate the advice the ggplot package authors give for those wishing to learn how to use ggplot:

## Inferential Statistics

### Distribution Functions

The sections below introduce functions for executing common statistical tests. However, R's family of distribution functions also make it possible to explore the underlying probability distributions for each test, and to carry out each test by hand. We therefore begin our demonstration of inferential statistics by giving an overview of these powerful instructional tools. 

The full list of available distributions can be found [here](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/R_Programming/Probability_Distributions). The following table provides an overview the distributions that are likely to be relevant to you as an instructor, including the suffix that each distribution is identified by in the functions below:

Distribution | Suffix | Parameters
:-------|:-------|:-------

Each distribution can be accessed by a set of four functions, each labelled with the distribution's suffix and a task-specific prefix:

Prefix | Task | Example
:-------|:------------------------------------------------------|:-------
d | Get the probability density associated with a point on the x-axis. | `dnorm()`
p | Get the probability of a value above or below a point on the x-axis. | `pnorm()`
q | Get the x-axis value marking a cumulative probability. | `qnorm()`
r | Get a random sample from the distribution. | `rnorm()`


These functions are each demonstrated in the following sub-sections using the normal distribution. In these examples, consider that IQ scores are meant to be normally distributed with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15:

```{r IQ histogram with curve, echo=FALSE}
hist(rnorm(10000, mean=100, sd=15), freq=FALSE, ylim=c(0, .03), xlab='', main='IQ Scores')
points(x=seq(40, 160, .001), y=dnorm(seq(40, 160, .001), mean=100, sd=15), type='l', col='red')
```

#### Getting Densities {-}

The functions for getting the probability density associated with a point on the x-axis, such as `dnorm()` in the case of the normal distribution, are unlikely to come up in class. However, they may be useful for generating figures such as the one above, which was created with the following code:

```{r IQ code for histogram with curve, eval=FALSE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=30)}
hist(rnorm(10000, mean=100, sd=15), freq=FALSE,
     ylim=c(0, .03), xlab='', main='IQ Scores')
points(x=seq(40, 160, .001),
       y=dnorm(seq(40, 160, .001), mean=100, sd=15),
       type='l', col='red')
```

Note that the input to `dnorm()` was a sequence of values from 40 to 160, by steps of .001. The output was the probability density for each value in the sequence. These values were then used to create a continuous curve that was added to the histogram of the data, in which the argument `freq=FALSE` ensured that the y-axis denoted probability densities instead of counts. A more detailed tutorial is provided [here](https://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~luke/classes/STAT4580/histdens.html).

#### Getting Probabilities {-}

You can use `pnorm()` to demonstrate that there is a 9.12% chance of getting an IQ score that is less than or equal to 80:

```{r pnorm example}
pnorm(80, mean=100, sd=15)
```

To find the probability of getting a value *greater than* or equal to a cutoff, such as 80, you can either add the argument `lower.tail=FALSE`:

```{r pnorm lower tail example}
pnorm(80, mean=100, sd=15, lower.tail=FALSE)
```

...or, since the area under the curve sums to 1, you can subtract the output of the previous command from 1:

```{r pnorm subtract example}
1-pnorm(80, mean=100, sd=15)
```

The latter method may be better for instructional purposes.

#### Getting Quantiles {-}

You can use `qnorm()` to demonstrate that an IQ score of 124.67 marks the 95^th^ percentile of scores:

```{r qnorm example}
qnorm(.95, mean=100, sd=15)
```

Similarly, you can add the argument `lower.tail=FALSE` to see the point on the x-axis that marks the *top* 95% of scores:

```{r qnorm lower tail example}
qnorm(.95, mean=100, sd=15, lower.tail=FALSE)
```

Note that subtracting from 1 does not work here as it did with `pnorm()` because the output of `qnorm()` is a quantile, which does not need to sum to 1 as probabilities do.

#### Getting Random Samples {-}

You can use `rnorm()` to randomly sample a class of 50 students from the population of IQ scores:

```{r rnorm example}
rnorm(50, mean=100, sd=15)
```

#### Running Statistical Tests by Hand {-}

These functions can be used to conduct statistical analyses by hand. Consider a demonstration of a z-test using the functions for the normal distribution. To test whether an IQ score of 135 is significantly different from the mean IQ score, first find the z-score:

```{r z-score}
IQ135_z <- (135-100)/15
IQ135_z
```

You could then compare that z-score to the critical z-scores associated with an alpha of .05, here assuming a two-tailed hypothesis:

```{r z cutoff}
qnorm(.025)
qnorm(.975)
```

The z-score of an IQ of 135 is greater than the critical z-score for the upper tail, so we can reject the null hypothesis. Note that for a one-tailed hypothesis, simply use one call to `qnorm()` with .05 or .95 for the lower or upper tail, respectively.

Alternatively, you could find the probability of getting a z-score that is equal to the test score or more extreme (in this case, more positive), and compare that to the alpha value instead of the critical z-score:

```{r z-score probability}
IQ135_z_prob <- 1-pnorm(IQ135_z)
```

The probability of getting an IQ of 135 is less than alpha (either .025 for a two-tailed hypothesis or .05 for a one-tailed hypothesis), so we reject the null hypothesis.

Note that you could also apply this method by finding the probability of an IQ of 135 given a mean of 100 and standard deviation of 15, and compare that to the alpha value instead:

```{r raw score probability}
IQ135_prob <- 1-pnorm(135, mean=100, sd=15)
```

This provides the same probability as for the z-score, so we make the same conclusion. However, though it uses one line of code instead of two, you may find that this method is more confusing for some students, particularly if they are used to seeing distributions centered on 0 elsewhere in the course. 

This same process can be extended to a range of statistical tests, including t tests, F tests, Chi-Square tests, and binomial tests. 

### Confidence Intervals

Confidence intervals can be calculated by hand in R using the distribution functions. Recall that the formula for a confidence interval is:

$$CI=\bar{x} \pm (critical \: statistic) \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$$

The following demonstration will be conducted using the normal distribution, but the same process can be generalized to other statistics. We will continue with the theoretical distribution of IQ scores used above in which the mean is 100 and the standard deviation is 15. 

Imagine that we tested the IQ of 100 students, simulated here with a call to `rnorm()`:

```{r IQ simulations, echo=FALSE}

# Sample 100 IQ scores
sample_IQ <- rnorm(100, mean=100, sd=15)

```

We know that the sample size, n, is 100. To find the 95% confidence interval, we would need to also find the sample mean, the sample standard deviation, and the critical z score that marks the .975 percentile:

```{r CI ingredients}

# Find the mean
mean_IQ <- mean(sample_IQ)

# Find the standard deviation
sd_IQ <- sd(sample_IQ)

# Find the critical z-score (upper tail)
z_crit <- qnorm(.975)

```

Note that we only need to find the z-score that marks the .975 percentile because the normal distribution is symmetric, so the critical z-score for the .025 percentile is simply the negative of this value. You can, however, choose to ask your students to find both separately if you think it would help from an instructional standpoint.

Then, we combine all of these ingredients to find the upper and lower limits of the confidence interval:

```{r CI combine}

# Find the lower limit
CI_lower <- mean_IQ - z_crit*(sd_IQ/sqrt(100))
CI_lower

# Find the upper limit
CI_upper <- mean_IQ + z_crit*(sd_IQ/sqrt(100))
CI_upper

```

The confidence interval ranges from 98.41 to 104.88.

Note that while calculating confidence intervals by hand is a useful instructional tool, some functions for statistical tests do give the confidence interval "for free", such as `t.test()` and `binom.test()`. Make sure to be clear with students when it is acceptable to get confidence intervals from these functions to complete assignments.

### `t.test()`

The `t.test()` function can be used to execute one-sample, paired, or two-sample t-tests. Each case is demonstrated below, but first note three general arguments that can be used to augment the test:

Argument | Values
:---------|:------------------------------------------
`alternative` | Set to `two.sided` for a two-sided test, `less` for the lower tail, and `greater` for the upper tail; the default is `two.sided`.
`var.equal` | Set to `TRUE` to assume equal variance and `FALSE` otherwise; the default is `FALSE`.
`conf.level` | Provide a number between 0 and 1 to specify the range for the confidence interval; the default is .95.

#### One-sample t-tests {-}

To demonstrate a one-sample t-test, imagine that we are curious whether the average verbal SAT score in the `sat.act` data set is different from 0. We could test that question with the following call:

```{r one-sample t-test}
t.test(sat.act$SATV)
```

The output of `t.test()` gives us a nice summary of the results, including the t-statistic, degrees of freedom, p-value, and 95% confidence interval. The p-value is essentially 0, so we can reject the null hypothesis that the average verbal SAT score is 0. 

If we wanted to instead see if the average verbal SAT score was different from 650, we could change the null comparison value by setting the `mu` parameter:

```{r one-sample t-test mu}
t.test(sat.act$SATV, mu=600)
```

The p-value is 0.004, so we can reject the null hypothesis that the average verbal SAT score is 600. Instead, it appears to be higher.

#### Paired t-tests {-}

To demonstrate a paired t-test, imagine that we are curious as to whether verbal SAT scores are different from quantitative SAT scores. We can conduct this in one of two ways. 

First, we could calculate the difference score for each pair, then run a one-sample t-test comparing the average difference score to 0:

```{r paired t-test diff}

# Calculate difference scores
sat.act$SAT_diff <- sat.act$SATV-sat.act$SATQ

# Run a one-sample t-test
t.test(sat.act$SAT_diff)

```
```{r remove sat_diff, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
sat.act <- sat.act[, 1:6]
```

The p-value is .566, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the difference between verbal and quantitative SAT scores are approximately zero.

In the second method, we could have `t.test()` compute the difference scores for us by specifying both samples and setting the `paired` argument to `TRUE`:

```{r paired t-test}
t.test(sat.act$SATV, sat.act$SATQ, paired=TRUE)
```

We get exactly the same result. However, note that though this method uses fewer lines of code it risks obscuring the role of difference scores for the student.

#### Two-sample t-tests {-}

To demonstrate a two-sample t-test, imagine that we are curious as to whether male and female students reported different quantitative SAT scores.

The function call is very similar to the second method for conducting a paired t-test, but we set the `paired` argument to `FALSE` instead:

```{r two-sample t-test}
t.test(sat.act$SATQ[sat.act$gender==1], sat.act$SATQ[sat.act$gender==2], paired=FALSE)
```

The p-value is approximately .00002, so we can reject the null hypothesis that male and female students report essentially the same quantitative SAT scores. Instead, the mean score for males appears to be higher.

Note that the default value for the `paired` argument is `FALSE`, so running the above call with the `paired` argument omitted would produce the same result. However, you might want to encourage students to always specify the argument for a t-test with two samples so that they can be sure they are running the intended test.

Further, note that the above example indexes the male and female groups within the call to `t.test()`, but you could also ask students to do this separately beforehand:

```{r two-sample t-test index}

# Subset the groups
male_SATQ <- sat.act$SATQ[sat.act$gender==1]
female_SATQ <- sat.act$SATQ[sat.act$gender==2]

# Run a two-sample t-test
t.test(male_SATQ, female_SATQ, paired=FALSE)

```

### `aov()`

The `aov()` function can be used to execute an ANOVA. The basic call includes one argument, which is a formula object. Whether `aov()` is used to run a one-way, two-way, or multi-way ANOVA, with or without interaction terms, is based entirely on the formula.

#### One-way ANOVA {-}

To demonstrate a one-way ANOVA, imagine that we are curious as to whether verbal SAT scores vary across education level:

```{r one-way ANOVA}
aov(sat.act$SATV ~ sat.act$education)
```

The standard output of aov does not contain readily interpretable results. To get the ANOVA table, it is better to save the output of `aov()`, then call `summary()` on that saved object:

```{r one-way ANOVA summary}
educ_aov <- aov(sat.act$SATV ~ sat.act$education)
summary(educ_aov)
```

Now we can see that the p-value is greater than an alpha of .05, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis that verbal SAT scores are equal across levels of education.

We might neaten up our code a bit by using the `data` argument to specify the data frame that our variables belong to. This allows us to just use the column names in the formula object:

```{r one-way ANOVA data arg}
educ_aov <- aov(SATV ~ education, data=sat.act)
summary(educ_aov)
```

#### Two-way ANOVA {-}

To demonstrate a two-way ANOVA, imagine that we are curious as to whether quantitative SAT scores vary across levels of education and gender:

```{r two-way ANOVA}
educ_gender_aov <- aov(SATQ ~ education + gender, data=sat.act)
summary(educ_gender_aov)
```

The p-value for education is .358, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis that quantitative SAT scores are equal across levels of education. The p-value for gender, however, is approximately zero, so we can reject the null hypothesis that quantitative SAT scores are equal across genders. To determine which gender has the highest scores, you might have your students find the means or create a barplot.

The two-way ANOVA that we just ran assumed an additive model, but perhaps we think that the effect of gender on quantitative SAT scores is different across different levels of education. To test this hypothesis with the interactive model, change the `+` symbol between the independent variables to an `*`:

```{r two-way ANOVA interaction}
educ_gender_aov_int <- aov(SATQ ~ education * gender, data=sat.act)
summary(educ_gender_aov_int)
```

The p-value for the interaction term is .610, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the effect of gender on quantitative SAT scores is the same across levels of education.

### `cor.test()`

The `cor.test()` function can be used to test the significance of a correlation. The correlation is measured by Pearsons's $r$ by default, but note that it can also be set to Kendall's $\tau$ or Spearman's $\rho$ with the `method` argument.

To demonstrate, imagine that we are curious as to whether verbal and quantitative SAT scores are linearly related:

```{r cor test}
cor.test(sat.act$SATV, sat.act$SATQ)
```

The p-value is essentially zero, so we can reject the null hypothesis that the correlation between verbal and quantitative SAT scores is zero. The estimate instead is .644, indicating a positive linear relationship.

This test was run with default parameter values for the alternative hypothesis and confidence level, which can be modified as follows:

Argument | Values
:---------|:------------------------------------------
`alternative` | Set to `two.sided` for a two-sided test, `less` for the lower tail, and `greater` for the upper tail; the default is `two.sided`.
`conf.level` | Provide a number between 0 and 1 to specify the range for the confidence interval; the default is .95.

### `binom.test()`

The `binom.test()` function can be used to test the significance of a proportion calculated from a binary variable. The test assumes a null proportion of .5, but this can be modified with the `p` argument.

To demonstrate, imagine that we are curious as to whether there are more males than females reporting their test scores. 

We first need to find the number of males and females in the data set, which we can do by creating a table of the `gender` variable:

```{r table gender}
gender_table <- table(sat.act$gender)
```

We can then call `binom.test()` on the table we created to test whether the proportion of males (the first category in the table) is significantly different from .5:

```{r binom example}
binom.test(gender_table)
```

The p-value is essentially zero, so we can reject the null hypothesis that the proportion of males is .5; instead, it seems there are more females than males.

Note that the same test can be run by specifying only the number of males in the first argument, then specifying the total number of observations (i.e., the number of rows in `sat.act`) using the `n` argument:

```{r binom n}

# Find the number of males
n_males <- length(sat.act$gender[sat.act$gender==1])

# Run the binomial test
binom.test(n_males, n=nrow(sat.act))

```

The first method is likely simpler if you are sticking to examples or assignments with real data, but the second method is more amenable to hypothetical scenarios, such as asking students to test whether a coin is fair if it produced 60 heads out of 100 flips.

This test was run with default parameter values for the alternative hypothesis and confidence level, which can be modified as follows:

Argument | Values
:---------|:------------------------------------------
`alternative` | Set to `two.sided` for a two-sided test, `less` for the lower tail, and `greater` for the upper tail; the default is `two.sided`.
`conf.level` | Provide a number between 0 and 1 to specify the range for the confidence interval; the default is .95.

### `chisq.test()`

The `chisq.test()` function can be used to execute either a Chi-Square test for goodness-of-fit or a Chi-Square test of independence, determined by whether a table with one or two groups is supplied, respectively.

#### Chi-Square test of Goodness-of-Fit {-}

To demonstrate the Chi-Square goodness-of-fit test, imagine that we are curious as to whether there are equal numbers of people in each education level measured in the `sat.act` data set. 

We first need to find the number of respondents in each education level, which we can do by creating a table of the `education` variable:

```{r table education}
educ_table <- table(sat.act$education)
```

We can then call `chisq.test()` on the table we created to test whether there are equal proportions of respondents in each education level:

```{r chi square goodness-of-fit}
chisq.test(educ_table)
```

The p-value is approximately zero, so we can reject the null hypothesis that the proportions are equal. From the table, we can see that respondent are more likely than not to have recieved at least some higher education.

By default, the Chi-Square test of independence tests the null hypothesis that the proportions are equal across groups, but this can be changed by providing a vector of proportions to the `p` argument. For instance, imagine that we wanted to test whether the proportions were equal to those from respondents in a neighboring state, which were much less likely to have been educated past high school:

```{r chi square goodness-of-fit p}
chisq.test(educ_table, p=c(.25, .25, .125, .125, .125, .125))
```

The p-value is approximately zero, so we can reject the null hypothesis that the proportions are the same as for the neighboring state.

#### Chi-Square test of Independence {-}

To demonstrate the Chi-Square test of independence, imagine that we are curious as to whether the proportions of males and females reporting their test scores are equal across levels of education. 

We first need to find the number of males and females in each level of education, which we can do by creating a table of the `gender` and `education` variables:

```{r table education gender}
educ_gender_table <- table(sat.act$education, sat.act$gender)
```

We can then call `chisq.test()` on the table we created to test whether there are equal proportions of males and females in each education level:

```{r chi square independence}
chisq.test(educ_gender_table)
```

The p-value is .007, so we can reject the null hypothesis that level of education is independent of gender. Instead, gender seems to be more balanced in the lower education levels, whereas there are more females than males in the higher education levels.
