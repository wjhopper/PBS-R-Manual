## Data

We rely on the `sat.act` data set from the `psych` package for all demonstrations in this chapter. 

To make the data set available on your own computer, run the following code:

```{r load psych, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('psych')
library(psych)
```

You should now be able to access the `sat.act` data set:

```{r access sat.act}
summary(sat.act)
```

As you can see, this data set includes self-reported SAT and ACT scores along with demographic information from 700 respondents. It therefore contains both categorical and continuous variables that are appropriate for both within- and between-subjects analyses. For more information, refer to the help documentation by running the command `?sat.act`.
