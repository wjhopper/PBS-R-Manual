The book is organized into three main sections: An introduction to the R language and the Rstudio development environment. A reference for performing and interpreting common statistical tests in R. Recommended Best practices for instructors. Section 1 is primarily intended for instructors who are unfamiliar with the R language and it’s ecosystem. However, we recommended even experienced R users read it, as it is useful to remind yourself of the perspective the majority of your students will be approaching R from, and to get “on the same page” as your fellow instructors. Much of the information in this guide can be found in any “Introduction to R” book or resource. So, why write another one? There are two main reasons: To provide you with the information you need specifically for Psych 240 and 241, and none of the information you don’t. To provide opinionated guidance and reference material for the instructor specifically, not just the “average” R user. We hope that you find this guide useful as you embark on teaching a new class! Getting Started To follow along with the examples in this book, it is recommended that you install the latest version of R and RStudio to your personal computer. The R Language R is a complete programming language and computing environment designed to enable statistical modeling, data manipulation, and reporting. Despite its focus on statistics, it is still very feature rich - we can use it to perform mathematical calculations, create data visualizations, connect to remote databases, save results as files on your computers hard drive, and more. In fact, this entire manual was created in R! To get started, download and install the most current version of R for your operating system: Windows: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/ Mac OS X: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/ Linux: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/Linux/ (as always, see instructions for your specific Linux distribution) RStudio RStudio is a graphical program that simplifies common R related tasks, organizes information about your current R session, and generally makes it easier to use R. This type of program is called an Integrated Development Environment, or IDE for short. We strongly recommend using R within RStudio. However, it is important to understand that they are separate and distinct programs, and R can freely be used outside of RStudio. To help your students understand their relationship, you could offer the following analogy: RStudio is like a workbench and toolbox, where R is like a hammer. You do not need a workbench and toolbox to build something with your hammer - but having a workbench to rest your project on while you work, and a toolbox where all your nails are organized is very convenient, and will probably help you do your work faster and more accurately. The company which produces the RStudio software has several different products with “RStudio” in the name. You and your students will want to install the “RStudio Desktop - Open Source License” version (i.e., the free version): RStudio Desktop for Windows: http://rstudio.org/download/latest/stable/desktop/windows/RStudio-latest.exe RStudio Desktop for Mac OS X: http://rstudio.org/download/latest/stable/desktop/mac/RStudio-latest.dmg RStudio Desktop for Linux: Get .deb and .rpm packages here Formatting Conventions R source code (i.e. code run in the R console or from an R script) and output are presented in monospace font in regions with a light gray background. We do not include command line prompts (&gt; and +, like you would see in a real R console) to the R source code. This is to allow you to conveniently copy and run the code without having to delete the leading prompt symbols. All text output from executing R commands is denoted with two preceeding hashes (##). So, any time you see ## following a block of R code, you are looking at the output of the preeceeding command. Additional Materials As alluded to earlier, this is far from the only “Intro to R” material in existence, though this guide has been developed with Psych 240 and 241 specifically in mind. But we do encourage you to supplement your knowlege with outside sources. We recommend the following resources to learning about R programming: R in a Nutshell by Joseph Adler The Art of R Programming by Norman Matloff R for Data Science by Garrett Grolemund &amp; Hadley Wickham Advanced R by Hadley Wickham On campus, there are two great consulting resources for getting help with statistical analysis in R: The Institute for Social Science Research The Center for Research on Famlies Reproducibility The R session information when compiling this book is shown below: sessionInfo() ## R version 3.5.1 (2018-07-02) ## Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit) ## Running under: Windows 7 x64 (build 7601) Service Pack 1 ## ## Matrix products: default ## ## locale: ## [1] LC_COLLATE=English_United States.1252 ## [2] LC_CTYPE=English_United States.1252 ## [3] LC_MONETARY=English_United States.1252 ## [4] LC_NUMERIC=C ## [5] LC_TIME=English_United States.1252 ## ## attached base packages: ## [1] stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods base ## ## loaded via a namespace (and not attached): ## [1] compiler_3.5.1 magrittr_1.5 bookdown_0.11 htmltools_0.3.6 ## [5] tools_3.5.1 yaml_2.2.0 Rcpp_1.0.1 stringi_1.4.3 ## [9] rmarkdown_1.13 knitr_1.22 stringr_1.3.1 xfun_0.6 ## [13] digest_0.6.19 packrat_0.4.9-3 evaluate_0.14 "],
["introducing-r-and-rstudio.html", "Chapter 1 Introducing R and RStudio 1.1 Pane #1: The R Console 1.2 Pane #2: The Editor 1.3 Pane #3: Your R Session 1.4 Pane #4: Miscellaneous 1.5 Conclusion", " Chapter 1 Introducing R and RStudio 1.1 Pane #1: The R Console The R console allows you to execute R code (often called expressions, or commands) and see the results printed out. To execute R commands, place your cursor at the prompt (the &gt; symbol), type in your code, and press Enter. A simple and easy way to demonstrate using R console is to perform some basic arithmetic, just like a calculator. R has 5 basic arithmetic operators: + for addition - for subtraction * for multiplication / for division ^ for exponentiation 2 + 2 ## [1] 4 R respects the order of operations (i.e. PEMDAS) by default, so if you want to for a specific operation to be executed fist, you need to surround it with parenthesis. To see how grouping with parenthesis affects arithmetic operations, compare the following two examples: 2*10 + 3/10 ## [1] 20.3 2*(10 + 3)/10 ## [1] 2.6 The R console is the best place to start immersing yourself in the language by experimentation. It allows you to “code as you go”; run one command, see what you get, adjust it and test it again. However, the interactive nature of using the R console makes it a poor choice for saving your work to use again later, and for complicated, multi-step operations. When you know you need to repeat the same step again in the future (i.e. re-use code), or you have a task that requires intermediate steps, you should organize all your code into an R script. RStudio allows you to easily write and interactively test out your R scripts in the Editor Pane, which is introduced below. 1.2 Pane #2: The Editor The editor pane is where you can create, modify, and save plain text documents, and is designed to help you create and execute R scripts. An R script is just a text file that contains valid R code (the same kind of commands you would enter into the console), and commonly carries the .R file extension. You can think of an R script like a stand-alone computer program, but instead of double-clicking to run it, you run it via the R interpreter. You can create a new, blank R script by going to the File Menu ➡ New File ➡ R Script. Rstudio provides several methods for executing the code you’ve written. You can: Run a single line of code by placing your cursor on that line and pressing Ctrl + Enter (⌘ Command + Enter on Mac). Run multiple lines of code by selecting all the lines your want to run with your cursor and pressing Ctrl + Enter (⌘ Command + Enter on Mac). Run the entire R script by pressing the “Source” button in the top-right corner of the editor pane, or using the Ctrl + Shift + S keyboard shortcut (⌘ Command + Shift + S on Mac) No matter which method you use, the code you choose to run will be executed in the R console below, and you will see any results printed out there as well. Keeping your code in an R Script allows you to quickly and easily run many commands in a row, without having to type each one in every time you need to do it. Another reason to write your code in an R script is to keep a short explanation of what you are doing (and why!) together with your code. These short explanations are called comments In R, you write a comment by prefixing the comment’s text with the pound sign #. Comments can go on their own line, or at the end of an R expression. A Word Of Advice When new programmers keen to improve their skills hear the advice “keep your code in an R Script, not the console”, they often take it quite literally. And they take all the over code they have run in the console, copy it to an R script, save it, and run it all again later. Best practices achieved, right? However, new programmers frequently over apply this rule - they keep literally everything they’ve run, even commands that are syntactically incorrect and give errors or incorrect results. An R Script should not be a historical record - rather it should be evolve through editing and careful consideration, much the same way an essay does. So, when saving your code in an R Script, try keeping the following rule of thumb: Your R script should have all the commands you need, and none of the ones you don’t. This can be challenging for new programmers - the ability to identify what is necessary and what isn’t develops with time and expertise. So, don’t expect to be perfect at this in the beginning, but do expect to edit and re-edit your R scripts, and don’t treat your “Chapter 2 HW.R” file as your diary of working on your Chapter 2 homework. # Hi I am a comment. # The R interprer ignores me! 2*10 + 3/10 # comments can go here too! ## [1] 20.3 1.3 Pane #3: Your R Session 1.3.1 Variables and the Environment As your R scripts grow beyond adding and subtracting a few numbers, you will often want to save the results of your computations (like datasets, or the results of statistical models) to use multiple times, or to increase the clarity of your code. In R, you can save a value for later use by assigning it to a variable name. You can create a new variable using the assignment operator &lt;-, using the syntax name &lt;- value where name is a syntactically valid name, and value is the value you wish to assign. To demonstrate creating a variable, consider the code below, where I create a variable named x, assign it a value of 1, and then print out its value by typing x into the console and pressing enter. x &lt;- 1 x ## [1] 1 If you execute the first command x &lt;- 1 in your own console, you should see it appear in the “Environment” pane of the RStudio window. The environment pane is helpful for keeping track of all the variables you’ve created. If you ever want to clear your Environment (i.e., delete all the variables you’ve created), you can press the button. Variable names are mostly arbitrary (we could have used elephant or jumpluff instead of x), but there are some restrictions on variable names, the most important being: Spaces are not allowed The name cannot begin with a number. See the “Details” section of the make.names help page, and the list of reserved keywords for a complete set of naming rules. A word of advice When you exit RStudio, you will get a pop-up asking you if you want to “Save workspace image…” to some location on your hard drive. Any person’s natural inclination is to answer “Yes” - what fool doesn’t want to save their work? However, saving your “workspace image” and “saving your work” are not the same thing. Saving your workspace means saving the state of your R session (i.e., all the variables, you’ve created, packages you’ve loaded, etc.) so they everything can be reloaded the next time you start RStudio. Which sounds great. Until you get a month into the semester, and you’ve keep saving and loading an entire month of R sessions each time. You’ve run out of variable names and have resorted to naming things “xxxxxx” to avoid naming collisions. Or you forget to avoid naming collisions and obliterate that one variable you actually do care about. And now RStudio takes 2 minutes to start and shut down because you’ve created a behemoth. In short, saving your workspace sounds great, but encourages very bad practices. It encourages letting RStudio keep track of your past work, instead of writing R scripts, and you end up storing 10 pieces of junk for every one thing you do need. We STRONGLY advise you to disable this feature, and teach your students to disable it as well. To disable this feature, navigate to Tools Menu Global Options Basic. On this tab, set the “Save workspace to .RData on exit” option to “Never” using the drop down menu, as shown below. Your future self thanks you. ### History RStudio also keeps track of the R commands that you’ve run in the past. This is useful during experimentation and testing, because it allows you to quickly copy a previous command, modify it, and try it again. It can also be helpful when you discarded code because you thought it wasn’t useful or necessary, but later realize it was, and need to remind yourself what you did. The best was to access the history of your most recent commands is place your cursor in the console, and use the up and down arrow keys. Pressing the ⬆ arrow key will take you through older commands, and press the ⬇ arrow key will take you back to more recent commands. So, next time you need to edit the command you just gave, use the arrow keys to retrieve it instead of typing it out again! To access commands more than say, 10, commands in the past, you can use the “History” tab in the top-right pane of the RStudio window. This allows you to examine your history like scrolling through a file, or find commands matching key words, like using a search engine. Remember, the best way to remember what you’ve done is to record it in an R Script to use again later, but the “History” tab provides a useful backstop for those moments when you “slip up”. 1.4 Pane #4: Miscellaneous Don’t let the name of this section mislead you - this pane is just as important and useful as the others. IT provides a window into three of the most important things you need when using R: plots, packages, and help! 1.4.1 Plots This tab might be the killer feature of R Studio. As you might imagine, this is where figures and plots you create are displayed. R has many simple yet powerful visualization tools, but historically, actually getting those plots to show up somewhere has involved annoying, platform-specific boilerplate code. With the R Studio plot tab, you can forget about these details 95% of the time, and your plots just show up automatically. 1.4.2 Packages The so-called “base” installation of R you downloaded from cran.r-project.org has tons of useful tools for statistical modeling, data manipulation, and visualization built in, but it is far from exhaustive, and new things are being invented all the time! Thankfully, R has a fantastic extension mechanism called “packages”. R packages provide sets of additional commands you can easily install, load into R, and then use for yourself. Where can you find these packages, and how can you install them yourself? The gold-standard for R packages is the CRAN repository, which stands for the Comprehensive R Archive Network. You can install packages from this repository using the install.packages() command. For example, if I wanted to install the dplyr package (a popular packages which provides opinionated tools for data manipulation), I would execute the following command in the console: install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;) If this package has any dependencies (i.e., other packages it needs installed in order to function), R will download and install these dependencies automatically. Once the one-time,e installation process finishes, you can load it into your R session with the library command, like so: library(&quot;dplyr&quot;) Remember, installing a package is a one-time operation, but you do need to load the package with library each time you start R. The “Packages” pane provide a way to see what packages you have installed, and which ones are loaded (loaded packages have a check-mark in front of them). You can also use this pane to install new packages (instead of using the install.packages command, bulk-update all your installed packages, and remove an installed package you no longer want to keep. 1.4.3 Help The help pane provides a way for you to access documentation explaining how to use different R functions. You can search all the help pages from the search bar on the “Help” pane. If you know the name of the function you want to view help on, you can type in the console preceded by a question mark, and hit Enter. For example, if I wanted to see more information on how to use the install.packages function, I could type: ?install.packages press Enter, and the help page would automatically open. 1.5 Conclusion Here, we have given an introduction to some of the R language’s basic functionality (the interactive console, arithmetic, variables, plots and packages) by using the layout of the RStudio IDE as a guide. In the next sections, we demonstrate the basic tenants of the R language and basic R programming tasks, such as calling functions, creating and manipulating data structures, and importing data from files on your hard drive into R.

["r-programming-fundamentals.html", "Chapter 2 R Programming Fundamentals 2.1 Classes of Data 2.2 Data Structures 2.3 Operators 2.4 Functions 2.5 Data Manipulation", " Chapter 2 R Programming Fundamentals In this section, we outline the basic concepts of the R language (data classes, data structures, operators and functions), and demonstrate how to perform some common tasks. 2.1 Classes of Data The data you work with in R belong to one of several possible classes. The distinction between classes of data is crucial, because the class you instantiate your data with determines the set of possible operations you can perform on that data. R has 6 “atomic” classes of data, but you will only encounter 4 of these in Psych 240 and 241. These classes are: Numeric, Integer, Logical, and Character. They are dubbed “atomic” classes because they are the fundamental units of the language (i.e., you cannot access a more basic type of object than these 6 classes) and they provide the building blocks for more complex classes and data structures. The 4 frequently used classes are described in more detail below. 2.1.1 The Numeric Class The numeric class is used to represent real numbers (i.e., numbers with a fractional component), for example, 6.23. The numeric class is also known as the “double” class, because internally it utilizes double floating point precision. The numeric class is the default class used to represent numbers in R. So, if you were to execute the command 2 + 2 in the R console, R would represent those 2’s using the numeric class. Special Values R has several special numeric values. Inf and -Inf are used to represent positive and negative Infinity, respectively. NaN is used when the results of a numeric computation produce“Not A Number”., such as when multiplying a number produces a value too small for the computer to represent. NaN is often abused to represent missing values, but the special value NA should be preferred. 2.1.2 The Integer Class Just as in mathematics, the integer class can only represent whole numbers, e.g. 6. However, if you type 6 into the R console, R will not use the integer class to represent the 6. As mentioned just above, R will use the numeric data type to represent the 6. If you want to force R to use the integer class, you must terminate the number with an upper-case L, e.g. 2L. In practice, it usually makes little difference whether you use the integer class or the numeric class to represent whole numbers, so sticking with the default class of numeric is safe to do. 2.1.3 The Logical Class Logical data can only take on 2 possible values: TRUE (1) or FALSE (0). This type of datum is used to represent whether some state exists (is true) or does not exist (is false). TRUE and FALSE must be uppercase. They can can be abbreviated as T and F, but it is not recommended (The names T and F can be over-written with non-logical values, But TRUE and FALSE are reserved names that can never be overwritten. Such a restrictive class of data may not seem useful, but play an important role in data manipulation, as they can be used to indicate the presence (or absence) of other data values you are interested in. You can change a TRUE to a FALSE (or a FALSE to a TRUE) by prefixing them with the ! negation operator. TRUE ## [1] TRUE !TRUE ## [1] FALSE !FALSE ## [1] TRUE The ! operator isn’t useful when you are typing out literal TRUE and FALSES, but is useful in situations where you have a function which produces one type of logical, and but you’re interested in the opposite. We will look at such a case later in the logical indexing section. Special Values R uses the special value NA to denote when a value is missing. NA is technically a logical value, but can used alongside other atomic classes of data without issue. 2.1.4 The Character Class The character data type (sometimes referred to as the “string” data type) is used for representing textual data. To encode a string of text as character data in R, it must be wrapped in quotes (\" \" or ' ' are both acceptable). a &lt;- &quot;foobar&quot; a ## [1] &quot;foobar&quot; Without the quotes, R will interpret the text as the name of an R variable, and attempt to locate that variable. As demonstrated below, missing quotes is a common source of “object not found” errors. a &lt;- foobar ## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object &#39;foobar&#39; not found Sometimes, a value can be represented using either a Character or Numeric class. For example, 4.2 could be represented as a numeric by typing 4.2 or a character by typing \"4.2\". While these look similar, and print similarly, they behave very differently. Consider the following two operations. 4.2 + 1 ## [1] 5.2 &quot;4.2&quot; + 1 ## Error in &quot;4.2&quot; + 1: non-numeric argument to binary operator This illustrates the earlier point that different classes of data support different operations. Here, we can see that you cannot perform mathematical operations on Character data, even if the data could be interpreted numerically. 2.1.5 Factors Factors are not an atomic data class, but it is nearly impossible to use the R language and avoid encountering data with the Factor class. Factors are a hybrid class of data, in which values are printed out with character labels, but are represented internally with integers. Importantly, when a Factor variable is created, the range of possible new values it can take on is restricted - only values that belong to the set of initial values can be inserted or appended. Factors exists in order to have a data class that can represent categorical variables in statistical models such as ANOVA. The reason Factors are unavoidable is because many functions in R automatically convert Character data into Factors. Two notorious culprits are the data.frame function, and the read.csv function (both of which we will encounter later). New programmers often use these functions, unaware of the implicit conversations they carry out behind the scenes, and are surprised later on when they find that cannot perform some operation (like appending new Character values to ones they already have). Luckily, the conversion-happy behavior of these functions can be stopped by changing one of R’s global options, stringsAsFactors. To turn off this conversion, execute the command options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE) in your R Script or console. We STRONGLY recommend disabling this conversion. 2.1.6 Class detection and conversion Speaking of conversion, programmers commonly face the need to convert data of one class into data of another class. To determine which class of data you have, you can use the class function. For each atomic class, R provide a class detection function (starting with the prefix is.) which provides a TRUE or FALSE response, and a class conversion function (starting with the prefix as.). Consider the following examples: x &lt;- 1 class(x) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; is.numeric(x) ## [1] TRUE is.integer(x) ## [1] FALSE x &lt;- as.integer(x) class(x) ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; is.integer(x) ## [1] TRUE x &lt;- as.logical(x) # 1 converts to TRUE x ## [1] TRUE x &lt;- as.character(x) # TRUE converts to &quot;TRUE&quot; x ## [1] &quot;TRUE&quot; is.character(x) ## [1] TRUE Class conversion is not always possible (e.g., \"Z\" cannot be converted into a number) or without loss of information (e.g., a numeric like 6.23 cannot be converted to an integer without losing the .23.). 2.2 Data Structures In order to introduce variables and classes, we have restricted our examples to using single, scalar values, like 6 and \"foobar\". Of course, when analyzing data, it is necessary to group multiple values together. R provides several different types of data structures for this purpose, Think of data structures in R as big containers used for grouping together many values. After storing your data in these containers, you can reuse it multiple places (e.g. create an R object to store it) or access different subsets of it by position or name. Each type of data structure focuses on representing different classes of data, and different relationships between the values in the data structure. In Psych 240 and 241, you will encountered 4 types of data structures: Vectors, Matrices, Data Frames, and Lists. 2.2.1 Vectors Vectors are 1 dimensional data structures which can hold values of a single atomic class. Classes of data cannot be mixed within a vector. In other words, a vector can hold either Integer, Numeric, Character, or Logical values, but not any combination of those values. Vectors, no matter what type of data they hold, can be created by using the c() function in R, short for concatenate. Just place each value you want to be included in the vector inside the parenthesis, separated with a comma. The individual values held in the vector are referred to as elements, and vectors have a length equal to the number of elements it contains. You can check how many elements there are in a vector using the length() function new_vector &lt;- c(1, 10, 45, -1) length(new_vector) ## [1] 4 char_vector &lt;- c(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;, &quot;herp&quot;, &quot;derp&quot;) length(char_vector) ## [1] 4 c() can also combine existing vectors into a single, larger vector big_vec &lt;- c(new_vector, c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)) big_vec ## [1] 1 10 45 -1 1 2 3 4 5 If you need to create a vector that contains a long one-by-one numeric sequence, there is a shortcut for typing out all the values you need - the : operator. Put the first number in the sequence before the colon and the final number in the sequence after the colon: 5:50 ## [1] 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 ## [24] 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 After you create a vector, you can give each elements a name, using the names() function and a character vector. names(new_vector) &lt;- c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;) new_vector ## A B C D ## 1 10 45 -1 Names can be useful when you want to select a subset of the values in a vector, which will come up in Section 2.5.3. 2.2.2 Matrices Matrices in R are analogous to matrices from linear algebra, with the notable difference of being able to hold non-numeric types of data. They are a rectangular 2-D data structure, meaning that the number of elements in the matrix is be equal to the product of the number of rows and the number of columns. rows = dimension 1 columns = dimension 2 Like vectors, data types may not be mixed in a matrix (e.g. you cannot have some elements be characters and other be numeric, etc.) A matrix is created by feeding a vector into the matrix() function, and specifying either the number of rows or number of columns, or both. wide &lt;- matrix(c(1:3, 99:101), ncol = 3) wide ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 3 100 ## [2,] 2 99 101 long &lt;- matrix(c(1:3, 99:101), nrow = 3) long ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 1 99 ## [2,] 2 100 ## [3,] 3 101 If you want a large matrix but with only a few unique values, take advantage of R’s ability to recycle input. matrix(c(4), nrow = 3, ncol = 10) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10] ## [1,] 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 ## [2,] 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 ## [3,] 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 Note the matrix is filled up by column (i.e. first element goes to row 1 column 1, second element goes to row 2, column 1, etc.) matrix(c(4,0), nrow = 2, ncol = 10) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10] ## [1,] 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 ## [2,] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2.2.3 Data Frames Like matrices, Data Frames are are 2D, rectangular data structures, but are more flexible because they allow for different data types to be stored in each column. A Data Frame is usually the best way to store and work with a dataset that mixes qualitative and quantitative variables. Data frames can be created by passing name = value pairs to the data.frame() function. The values should be vectors (of any type) and the names should be unquoted strings of text, which will be used to label each column. Importantly, all the vectors stored in the data frame must be of identical length. Essentially, a data frame is a container that imposes a relational structure on a set of vectors. df &lt;- data.frame(x = c(1,4,4,2), y = c(3,3,1,4), month = c(&quot;Sep&quot;,&quot;Oct&quot;,&quot;Nov&quot;,&quot;Jan&quot;), stringsAsFactors = FALSE) df ## x y month ## 1 1 3 Sep ## 2 4 3 Oct ## 3 4 1 Nov ## 4 2 4 Jan This example also shows an extra argument, stringsAsFactors = FALSE, that was not a variable to store in the data frame. This argument is another way to controls how R interprets character vectors (a.k.a. strings) when forming the data frame. Here, using stringsAsFactors = TRUE forces R to leave your character vectors as they are when creating the data frame. 2.2.4 Lists Lists are the most abstract and flexible data structure in R. Lists can hold any type of R object, but doesn’t impose any relationship between them. You can have a list holding matrices, data frames, vectors, and even lists holding other lists! Think of lists like a folder on your hard drive. You can stuff any kind of file you like in there and give it a name, but there is no relationship between them inside that folder, other than the order they are sorted in. Use a list when you need to group data structures of different sizes and types together. But carefully consider if there is another way, because the lack of structured relationships between the data in different list elements can make them tricky to work with As you might have guessed, you can create lists of your own with the list() function. Like the data.frame() function, you pass in name=value pairs. But now, the values can be any R object, of any size, not just vectors with the same lengths. biglist &lt;- list(first = -10:-15, second = data.frame(x=c(&quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;), y = 1:2)) biglist ## $first ## [1] -10 -11 -12 -13 -14 -15 ## ## $second ## x y ## 1 A 1 ## 2 B 2 2.3 Operators Creating data structures is great, but creating them is rarely ever the goal we have in mind - we always want to manipulate and perform computations using our data. Nearly every analysis you perform will make use of R’s inline operators. We’ve seen these operators already when we did arithmetic in the R console. As a reminder, R has 5 basic arithmetic operators: + for addition - for subtraction * for multiplication / for division ^ for exponentiation R also has two other types of operators: Relational operators and Logical operators. 2.3.1 Relational Operators As the name implies, relational operators are used to examining the relationship between values. R has 6 relational operators: &lt;: The “less than” operator &lt;=: The “less than or equal to” operator &gt;: The “greater than” operator &gt;=: The “greater than or equal to” operator == The “equal to” operator != The “not equal to” operator All 6 of these operators can be used sensibly on Integer and Numeric data, while only the last two can be used sensibly on Logical and Character data. Each of these operators returns it’s answer in the form of a Logical value. Consider the following examples that demonstrate each operator: 1 &lt; 2 ## [1] TRUE 1 &gt; 2 ## [1] FALSE 2 &gt; 2 ## [1] FALSE 2 &gt;= 2 ## [1] TRUE 2 == 2 ## [1] TRUE 2 != 2 ## [1] FALSE 1 != 2 ## [1] TRUE &quot;hi&quot; == &quot;hello&quot; ## [1] FALSE &quot;bye&quot; == &quot;bye&quot; ## [1] TRUE &quot;bye&quot; != &quot;bye&quot; ## [1] FALSE These relational operators can be applied to matrices and vectors as well. When applied to matrices and vectors, they operate element-wise, meaning they operate on each element of the vector or matrix one at a time, and give you an answer for each individual element. So, if you apply the == operator to a vector with 10 values, you will get 10 TRUE/FALSE answers. c(10, 5, -10) &gt; 0 ## [1] TRUE TRUE FALSE c(10, 5, -10) == 0 ## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE c(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;, &quot;herp&quot;, &quot;derp&quot;) == &quot;bar&quot; ## [1] FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE When you have a vector or matrix on both sides of the operator, it still operates element-wise. In this situation, it will match up the elements on each data structure by position (first with first, second with second, etc.). c(10, 5, -10) &gt; c(20, -5, 0) ## [1] FALSE TRUE FALSE c(10, 5, -10) == c(20, -5, 0) ## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE When using relational operators with two vectors/matrices, make sure they both have the same number of elements. If not, R will recycle values from the beginning of the shorter vector in order to “pad” it’s length. This is probably not what you want to happen, but R will only warn you if the length of the longer vector is not a multiple of the shorter vector. If it is a multiple, then R will recycle silently. Be vigilant! c(10, 5) == c(20, -5, 0, 50) # No warning, 4 is a multiple of 2 !!! ## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE c(10, 5) == c(20, -5, 0) # Recycling warning, 3 is not a multiple of 2 ## Warning in c(10, 5) == c(20, -5, 0): longer object length is not a multiple ## of shorter object length ## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE 2.3.2 Logical Operators R’s logical operators are used for combining together multiple Logical values into a single Logical value. The 5 main logical operators are: !: The “negation” operator (mentioned in the Logical Data section) &amp;: The “element-wise and” operator &amp;&amp;: The “scalar and” operator ||: The “element-wise and” operator |: The “scalar and” operator We will not cover the use of these operators in the guide, as they go beyond the programming scope expected of Psych 240 and 241 students. Interested instructors are advised to look at examples here: Manipulating Data Logical Operators in R 2.4 Functions We have used functions in several previous examples, without providing explanation of what an R function is, or how they are used generally. But understanding the basics of functions in R is important, because all of R’s analysis and modeling tools are accessed by using function. In this section, we will describe what a function is generally, and explain how to learn what a function does by reading documentation. So, what is a function? A function is fixed piece of code that accepts input values, performs some operations or calculations on these values, and returns some results. The purpose of having functions in a programming language is to allow you to repeat an operation without have to repeat all of the code that defines the operation - the code is “bundled” into a function, and can be re-used infinitely without copying and pasting the code each time. A good way to start thinking about functions by analogy to equations. For instance, if we have the equation \\(y=\\sqrt{x}\\): \\(x\\) is the input \\(\\sqrt{}\\) is the operation performed on the input \\(y\\) is the output, in this case the result of taking the square root of \\(x\\) When you use a function, you are performing a ‘function call’ (in computer science-ish terms). This leads to colloquialisms like “Call mean on that matrix” or “This code calls diag to extract the diagonal elements”. ‘Call’ does not mean anything special to us. All using the word ‘call’ means in this context is ‘use a function’. The inputs to functions go by several names, but most often they are called “arguments” or “parameters”. Calling a function with some specific input is often called “passing an argument”. Don’t confuse function parameters with population parameters from the statistics side of class Perhaps the best way to understand the properties of R functions, and how they can be used, is to look the documentation of an R function. Here, we’ll examine the documentation for a function we’ve used previously, the matrix function. We’ll access it by executing the command ?matrix in the console. ?matrix We’ll focus on the Description, Usage, and Arguments section, shown below: matrix R Documentation Matrices Description matrix creates a matrix from the given set of values. as.matrix attempts to turn its argument into a matrix. is.matrix tests if its argument is a (strict) matrix. Usage matrix(data = NA, nrow = 1, ncol = 1, byrow = FALSE, dimnames = NULL) as.matrix(x, ...) ## S3 method for class 'data.frame' as.matrix(x, rownames.force = NA, ...) is.matrix(x) Arguments data an optional data vector (including a list or expression vector). Non-atomic classed R objects are coerced by as.vector and all attributes discarded. nrow the desired number of rows. ncol the desired number of columns. byrow logical. If FALSE (the default) the matrix is filled by columns, otherwise the matrix is filled by rows. dimnames A dimnames attribute for the matrix: NULL or a list of length 2 giving the row and column names respectively. An empty list is treated as NULL, and a list of length one as row names. The list can be named, and the list names will be used as names for the dimensions. x an R object. … additional arguments to be passed to or from methods. rownames.force logical indicating if the resulting matrix should have character (rather than NULL) rownames. The default, NA, uses NULL rownames if the data frame has ‘automatic’ row.names or for a zero-row data frame. 2.4.1 Description As you might expect, the Description section describes what the function is used for, and lists the functions that are documented in this page. Here, the matrix, as.matrix and is.matrix functions are documented. 2.4.2 Usage The usage section tells you: The syntax for invoking the function The names of the accepted arguments The order of the arguments Which arguments are required and which are optional Arguments with an = are optional All others are required We can see that the matrix function has 5 arguments, data, nrow, ncol, byrow and dimnames, each with a default argument. Because all the arguments have defaults, we know that we can call the matrix function with no arguments and still get a result! Lines saying “S3 Method for class …” tell you about the functions’ behavior when called on objects of a specific class. For example, this help page tells us that when the as.matrix function is called on a data.frame, there is an optional argument called rownames.force that isn’t used when the input is some other data structure (like a vector). We can safely ignore the cryptic term “S3 Method”. But, we will focus on other cryptic parts of the “Usage” section. But the usage section is also cryptic! What is x? What is trim? What do they do? For clarification, we must go the arguments sections. 2.4.3 Arguments The detailed descriptions in the arguments section tell us what types of values each argument is permitted to take on. It also tells us what aspect of the function’s behavior each argument controls. For example, the byrow argument must be a logical value (i.e., TRUE or FALSE) and it controls whether the matrix is row-by-row, or column-by-column. 2.4.4 Named vs. Unnamed Arguments As we see in the “Usage” and “Arguments” sections, every function argument has a name (e.g., x, na.rm, trim). When you call a function, those names can be used in a keyname = value style of syntax, or they may be omitted in favor of just specifying the value. If you wish to omit the names of the arguments when calling a function you must order your inputs in the exact same order as they appear in the Usage section!!! If you specify arguments as keyname=value pairs, they may be passed in any order. If you mix and match named and unnamed, unnamed inputs that R encounters will be paired up with the unmatched arguments following their order in the Usage section. x &lt;- c(4,10,3,33,2,NA,43,22,31,95) matrix(data=x, byrow=TRUE, nrow=2, ncol=5) # named key/value style ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] ## [1,] 4 10 3 33 2 ## [2,] NA 43 22 31 95 matrix(x, 2, 5, TRUE) # unnamed style, byrow goes last ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] ## [1,] 4 10 3 33 2 ## [2,] NA 43 22 31 95 matrix(x, TRUE, 2, 5) #5 gets matched up with byrow, not ncol! ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 4 10 2.4.5 A word of advice So, which style should you prefer when writing code in an R script: named or unnamed arguments? We recommend using named arguments for all arguments past the first. This strikes a balance between verbosity and clarity - it is often easy to remember what the first argument to a function does and what kind of values it should take on, but it is often difficult to remember the role and order of arguments beyond that. For example, you have just read the documentation for the matrix function - can you remember whether the nrow or ncol argument goes first? Are you confident enough to just write some code without looking it up. And are you confident that you’ll still remember whether you’re making a 10 by 50 or a 50 by 10 matrix when you re-read your code tomorrow? We would venture to guess the answer to these questions is “No”, which makes a strong case for naming your arguments when you write your code. Trust us, if you ever venture into a programming language without support for named arguments (I’m looking at you, MATLAB), you’ll yearn for named arguments. In summary, name your arguments. Special Arguments You may have noticed that in the “Usage” section, the as.matrix and the is.matrix functions have an argument called .... In fact, many R functions have such an argument. A full discussion of the ... construct is beyond the scope of this guide (or the ellipsis, if you’re trying to Google it) is beyond the scope of this guide. For our purposes, we can understand it as a special “catch all” device for any parameters inputs that aren’t otherwise explicitly declared. The ... is used to enable argument passing between functions: it allows one function to capture arguments intended for another function, and send them directly to the other function, without ever know what the names of the arguments for the other function. Neat! Examples The last section of the matrix help page we will look at is “Examples” sections matrix R Documentation Matrices Examples is.matrix(as.matrix(1:10)) !is.matrix(warpbreaks) # data.frame, NOT matrix! warpbreaks[1:10,] as.matrix(warpbreaks[1:10,]) # using as.matrix.data.frame(.) method ## Example of setting row and column names mdat &lt;- matrix(c(1,2,3, 11,12,13), nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE, dimnames = list(c(\"row1\", \"row2\"), c(\"C.1\", \"C.2\", \"C.3\"))) mdat The examples sections demonstrate a simple application of the function. When using a function for the first time, or you find yourself confused by a part of the documentation, running and tweaking the examples you find here is a great way to get a concrete understanding of how the function behaves. The Return Value The matrix function lacks one field in the help file that most R function have - the “Value” field. This section describes what the function outputs, i.e., what it “returns” to the caller. The matrix function can get away with omitting this section, because it’s return value is fairly obvious - a matrix! But functions with more complicated outputs need to describe what they return in more detail, so the user can understand how to process the output in their own code. 2.5 Data Manipulation Data manipulations describes the processes of editing and re-organizing a set of observations in order to facilitate a subsequent analysis. In this guide, we will cover three main data manipulation processes: indexing, subsetting, and replacement. Since data manipulations typically begins by importing data from a file on your hard drive into R, we will begin this section describing how to import or “read in” 2.5.1 Tidy Data It’s worth beginning with an outline of a well-formatted data set. The data is represented in a rectangular structure (table with rows and columns) Each column represents a specific variable, with a header signifying the name of this variable Each row is represents an observation Avoids names or values with blank spaces Avoids using names that contain symbols such as :, ;, ?, $, %, ^, &amp;, *, (, ), -, #, ?, &lt; , &gt;, /, |, [, ], { and } Any missing values in your data set are indicated with NA Adhering to these principles when you save new data, or manipulate data you have, will greatly simplify analysis performed in R. 2.5.2 Importing Data CSV files A CSV file is a type of plain-text document, and is indicated by the .csv file extension. Plain text files consist only of sequences of characters codes, including spaces, tabs, new lines and delimiters. They have no styling associated with them (e.g. no italics or bolding, no images). Files with extensions such as .txt, .R and .html are plain-text files, while files such as .doc, .docx (Word documents) and .xlsx (Excel documents) are not plain text files. We recommend you use plain-text formats for sharing data, because they have the greatest deal of interoperability between computer operating systems and analysis programs. In a CSV file, the content is arranged in a tabular format. Each new line in the file represents a row, and distinct values within each row are separated by commas to form the different columns. Below is an example of what a CSV file looks like before it is imported into R: commas &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/commas.csv&quot;) write.csv(commas, file=&quot;&quot;, quote=FALSE, row.names=FALSE) ## condition,trial,rating ## a,1,3 ## b,2,1 ## c,3,11 We can see that the file has 3 columns, a header row, and 3 observation rows. Before we can import this file into R, we must know how to instruct R where to find the file on our computer, and . To do this, we must understand about file paths on our hard drive, and how R looks for files. File Paths and Working Directories All the files stored on your computer’s hard drive are associated with a named location in the file system’s hierarchy. For example, Windows users are likely familiar storing files inside the “My Documents” folder (also known as a “directory”). Much like a file, the R session you have open is also associated with a directory on your hard drive. But, unlike a file, your R session can easily change it’s current location without copying the session. The directory your R session currently inhabits is called the “Current Working Directory”. You can see what this directory is by issuing the command getwd(). getwd() ## [1] &quot;C:/Users/will/source/PBS R Manual&quot; As you can see, the current working directory of my R session is the PBS R Manual folder. I can change this location using the setwd() command, and providing the name of another directory to move the R session to. The new directory I move to needs to be specified as a Character value (i.e., surrounded with quotation marks). However, I have to be very clear and explicit when describing the location of this directory. Specifically, I have describe this directories location using either a relative or an absolute path. An absolute file path describes the location in relationship to the beginning of the entire file system, while a relative path describes the location in relationship to R’s current working directory. This is important, because not every location on your hard drive is visible from R’s current directory - R can only see files below it’s current working directory in the file system hierarchy. If you need to access a file that is not below your current working directory, the best way to do this is with an absolute file path. On Windows, the start of each file system is given a letter prefix; the prefix of the file system holding the Window’s installation is C:\\. Directories are separated with backward slashes (e.g. C:\\Users\\will is an absolute path). On Mac OSX and Linux, the start of the file system is / (read as “root”). Here, directories are separated with forward slashes (e.g., /Users/will is an absolute path). But in R, you don’t have to worry about forward slashes vs. backward slashes. You can use forward slashes in your code, and it will work on either Mac or Windows If you need to access a file that is not below your current working directory, the best way to do this is with a relative file path. A relative file path doesn’t need to begin with C:\\ or \"/\", it can just begin with the name of the file or directory. Let’s do this now with the CSV file we saw in the previous section. read.csv The R function used for importing CSV files is called read.csv. It has one required argument, the file path describing the name and location of the CSV file to import. In this case, the CSV file is named commas.csv and it is stored in a directory named data that is in my current working directory. Let’s import it now: commas &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/commas.csv&quot;) class(commas) ## [1] &quot;data.frame&quot; commas ## condition trial rating ## 1 a 1 3 ## 2 b 2 1 ## 3 c 3 11 Note that I assigned the output of the read.csv function to variable named commas, and that the function imported the CSV file as a data.frame object. Also note that the values in the first row of the CSV file were used as names for each columns, rather than a row of data. Importing Excel Files Excel files are ubiquitous, but because of their history as a proprietary format, R does not have native support for importing them. However, all is not lost: you can install the readxl package and use it’s read_excel function to import .xls and .xlsx files into R as data frames. 2.5.3 Subsetting Subsetting describes the processes of “extracting” or “slicing out” a subset of the values from one data structure into another. In R, the processes of subsetting does not remove the values you subset from the original data structure. Rather, it creates a copy of the subset you ask for, and puts that copy into your new data structure. So, subsetting is a safe operation that will not result in any data loss. Subsetting a data structure is performed in R using the [] operator, which are called square brackets. All R data structures can be subsetted using the [] operators. To subset a data structure, the [] operator immediately after the data structure. Between the two square brackets, you place what is known as an index vector. An index vector is a vector that describes which values in the data structure you want included in the subset. There are 3 types of index vectors: Numeric Index Vectors, which describe the position (e.g. first, third, or 19th) of the elements you want included in the subset. Character Index Vectors, which describe the names of the elements you want included in the subset (only useful when the elements have names). Logical Index Vectors, which specify for each element in the data structure whether it should be included, or excluded, from the subset. We’ll start with subsetting vectors with a numeric index vectors to get a feel for the general procedure. Subsetting with a Numeric Index alphabet &lt;- c(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;,&quot;d&quot;,&quot;e&quot;,&quot;f&quot;,&quot;g&quot;,&quot;h&quot;,&quot;i&quot;,&quot;j&quot;,&quot;k&quot;,&quot;l&quot;,&quot;m&quot;,&quot;n&quot;,&quot;o&quot;, &quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;,&quot;r&quot;,&quot;s&quot;,&quot;t&quot;,&quot;u&quot;,&quot;v&quot;,&quot;w&quot;,&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot;) alphabet[c(1,26)] # Extract First and 26th element ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;z&quot; alphabet[10:20] # Extract tenth through 20th ## [1] &quot;j&quot; &quot;k&quot; &quot;l&quot; &quot;m&quot; &quot;n&quot; &quot;o&quot; &quot;p&quot; &quot;q&quot; &quot;r&quot; &quot;s&quot; &quot;t&quot; One of the most common mistake is including a value in your indexing vector which is greater than the length of the vector you are subsetting alphabet[100] # there are not 100 letters in the alphabet ## [1] NA The NA means the value is missing. This is commonly referred to as an “index out of bounds” error, although R does not explicitly give you an error. Another common mistake is forgetting to concatenate the values you want to use for the indexing vector (i.e. forgetting the c() function). alphabet[1,5] ## Error in alphabet[1, 5]: incorrect number of dimensions This time, R does give us an error, letting us know that we’ve attempted to index a vector like a matrix. “Negative” Subsetting Instead of creating a vector of values you do want to pick out, it may be easier to come up with a vector of ones you don’t want. We can use negative number’s to specify which vector elements we don’t want. alphabet[c(-1,-26)] # Same as alphabet[2:24] ## [1] &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; &quot;d&quot; &quot;e&quot; &quot;f&quot; &quot;g&quot; &quot;h&quot; &quot;i&quot; &quot;j&quot; &quot;k&quot; &quot;l&quot; &quot;m&quot; &quot;n&quot; &quot;o&quot; &quot;p&quot; &quot;q&quot; &quot;r&quot; ## [18] &quot;s&quot; &quot;t&quot; &quot;u&quot; &quot;v&quot; &quot;w&quot; &quot;x&quot; &quot;y&quot; alphabet[-1:-10] ## [1] &quot;k&quot; &quot;l&quot; &quot;m&quot; &quot;n&quot; &quot;o&quot; &quot;p&quot; &quot;q&quot; &quot;r&quot; &quot;s&quot; &quot;t&quot; &quot;u&quot; &quot;v&quot; &quot;w&quot; &quot;x&quot; &quot;y&quot; &quot;z&quot; Indexing with positive vectors is usually preferred, as the intent of the code is more clear, but sometimes this form can be clearer when constructing the “anti-set” is easier (e.g. when dropping the first value). Subsetting with a Character Index If the elements of our vector have names, we can use those names instead of their positions. x &lt;- 1:5 names(x) &lt;- c(&quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;,&quot;C&quot;,&quot;D&quot;,&quot;F&quot;) x ## A B C D F ## 1 2 3 4 5 x[c(&quot;B&quot;,&quot;F&quot;)] ## B F ## 2 5 Subsetting with a Logical Index When subsetting with a logical index vector, you supply a vector specifying whether to extract a specific element (with a TRUE) or to not extract a specific element (with a FALSE). Let’s revisit the example of selecting the first and last elements of the alphabet vector: We make a vector of logicals and stick it in the square brackets after your vector. alphabet[c(1,26)] ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;z&quot; alphabet[c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)] ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;z&quot; But this specific example is not a good use case for logical vectors. Why? Longer Code: length of the logical vector must match the length of the object its subsetting. Duplicating work: If you already know the position of the elements you want, just put them into a vector and you’re done! The logical vector’s utility comes into play when you don’t know the numeric positions of the elements you are interested in. But, how can you determine which values you want to keep without knowing their position or their name? In these cases, we must search for values meeting a specific criteria. Searching for values within a data structure is a processes called Indexing. 2.5.4 Indexing Indexing a data structure in a search for specific values is a job for R’s relational operators. Remember, relational operator are applied to all the elements of a data structure individually (i.e., “element-wise”). Thus, we can apply them to search for specific values, and use the Logical TRUE/FALSE values that result from this search as an index vector. x &lt;- 2:11 print(x) ## [1] 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 x &lt;= 5 # Apply the less than or equals test ## [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE As you can see, values that meet the criteria (&lt;= 5) return as TRUE. x[x &lt;= 5] # Index vector x with the results of the test. ## [1] 2 3 4 5 When this logical vector is used to index the vector x, only the elements where the logical vector has value TRUE are returned. We index character vectors using the == and != operators, but not the greater/less than operators. Quantity makes no sense for characters! months &lt;- c(&quot;January&quot;, &quot;February&quot;, &quot;March&quot;, &quot;April&quot;, &quot;May&quot;, &quot;June&quot;, &quot;July&quot;, &quot;August&quot;, &quot;September&quot;, &quot;October&quot;, &quot;November&quot;, &quot;December&quot;) months == &quot;June&quot; # The sixth element is TRUE ## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [12] FALSE months[months == &quot;June&quot;] ## [1] &quot;June&quot; months[months != &quot;July&quot;] ## [1] &quot;January&quot; &quot;February&quot; &quot;March&quot; &quot;April&quot; &quot;May&quot; ## [6] &quot;June&quot; &quot;August&quot; &quot;September&quot; &quot;October&quot; &quot;November&quot; ## [11] &quot;December&quot; Other Useful Tests: is.na() Unfortunately, we often have to deal with missing observations in real world data sets. R codes missing data as NA (or sometimes NaN). We can use the is.na() function to find any missing values in a vector. missingno &lt;- c(10,NA,1,4,2,NA,NA,99,NaN, NA) is.na(missingno) ## [1] FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE missingno[!is.na(missingno)] # Select the *not* missing observations ## [1] 10 1 4 2 99 Removing missing values in a common step in data manipuation before an anlysis. For examples of removig missing values with other data structures, and more realistic data sets, the examples in the Data Sets section. Converting a Logical to a Positional Index A useful function to know is which(). When used on a logical vector, it will return to your the position indices of the vector’s TRUE element. It is useful when you want to know where in the vector your matches occur. is.na(missingno) ## [1] FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE which(is.na(missingno)) ## [1] 2 6 7 9 10 2.5.5 Replacement To replace the values in a vector (e.g., to replace empty characters with NA values), move the indexing and subsetting operation to the right-hand side of the assignment operator, and put the replacement value(s) on the left-hand side. song &lt;- c(&quot;Happy&quot;, &quot;Birthday&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;You&quot;) song[song == &quot;&quot;] &lt;- NA song ## [1] &quot;Happy&quot; &quot;Birthday&quot; NA &quot;You&quot; A word of advice Unlike subsetting, replacement does present the risk of data loss, because once a value is replaced, it can’t be undone. So, when you are experimenting, we recommend you make a “backup” copy of your data structure before editing it. In the previous example, with the “Happy Birthday” lyrics, you might do the following. song &lt;- c(&quot;Happy&quot;, &quot;Birthday&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;You&quot;) song_original &lt;- song song[song == &quot;&quot;] &lt;- NA song ## [1] &quot;Happy&quot; &quot;Birthday&quot; NA &quot;You&quot; song_original ## [1] &quot;Happy&quot; &quot;Birthday&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;You&quot; This way, you have a copy of the original data, in case there was a bug in your code, or you need the raw data later on for another operation. 2.5.6 Matrices &amp; Data Frames Now we’ll learn how to index data structures with more than one dimension, like matrices and data frames. Recall that matrices and data frames have both rows and columns,meaning that when we subset or index them, we must specify which rows and/or columns we would like out subset or search to apply to. Matrices To index a matrix, all that is required is to have two vectors inside our square brackets, separated from each other by a comma. The template is: OurBigMatrix[rowIndex, columnIndex] Like with vectors, the index vectors can be either: Numeric vectors specifying the position of the rows/columns we want to access Character vectors specifying the names of the rows/columns we want to access (if they have names) Logical vectors specifying for each column and row whether we want to access it (TRUE) or ignore it (FALSE) dummy &lt;- matrix(6:1, nrow = 2) dummy ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 6 4 2 ## [2,] 5 3 1 dummy[1,2:3] # Row 1, Column 2 and 3. Output is a vector! ## [1] 4 2 dummy[1:2,2:3] # Row 1 and 2, Column 2 and 3. Output is a matrix. ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 4 2 ## [2,] 3 1 If you want to select all of one dimension, (e.g., keep all rows or all columns) but index the other dimension, provide the separating comma as usual, but don’t give any indexing vector for the dimension you want to stay 100% intact. dummy[1,] # First Row, all columns ## [1] 6 4 2 dummy[1,1:3] # Same as previous ## [1] 6 4 2 dummy[,2] # All rows, second columns ## [1] 4 3 dummy[1:2,2] # Same as previous ## [1] 4 3 We can apply our relational operators to entire matrices in the same manner as vectors. The resulting logical matrix has the same dimensions as the one we apply the test to. dummy &lt; 4 # 2 x 3 ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] FALSE FALSE TRUE ## [2,] FALSE TRUE TRUE We can also apply logical testing and logical indexing to specific dimensions of a matrix. This example here keeps all the columns of the matrix with a sum less than 8. colSums(dummy) # colSums() adds up each column ## [1] 11 7 3 colSums(dummy) &lt; 8 # Does each column sum to less than 8? ## [1] FALSE TRUE TRUE dummy[,colSums(dummy) &lt; 8] # Select columns with a sum less than 8 ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 4 2 ## [2,] 3 1 Data Frames To learn about data frames, we’re going to use several data frames that come built-in with R as part of the datasets package. Try typing InsectSprays, iris, airquality and mtcars into the console to be sure they are loaded and available to you. Since they are included as part of a package, you will not see them listed in your environment pane. The [row, column] indexing style used with matrices also applies to data frames. However, data frames also support a different subsetting technique based on a special syntax that applies to it’s column names. Subsetting or indexing a data frame using column names should be preferred to using column numbers, because that name is unlikely to change, while the row or column number is very likely to get changed throughout the course of an analysis. It’s also much easier to remember the name of something than remember its position in a data frame! Subsetting with $ syntax To subset a single column from a data frame, we can use that columns name, and the $ operator. In this case, quotes around the column’s name are not required. To demonstrate, we will subset the mpg column from the mtcars dataset. mtcars ## mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am gear carb ## Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160.0 110 3.90 2.620 16.46 0 1 4 4 ## Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160.0 110 3.90 2.875 17.02 0 1 4 4 ## Datsun 710 22.8 4 108.0 93 3.85 2.320 18.61 1 1 4 1 ## Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6 258.0 110 3.08 3.215 19.44 1 0 3 1 ## Hornet Sportabout 18.7 8 360.0 175 3.15 3.440 17.02 0 0 3 2 ## Valiant 18.1 6 225.0 105 2.76 3.460 20.22 1 0 3 1 ## Duster 360 14.3 8 360.0 245 3.21 3.570 15.84 0 0 3 4 ## Merc 240D 24.4 4 146.7 62 3.69 3.190 20.00 1 0 4 2 ## Merc 230 22.8 4 140.8 95 3.92 3.150 22.90 1 0 4 2 ## [ reached getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 23 rows ] mtcars$mpg ## [1] 21.0 21.0 22.8 21.4 18.7 18.1 14.3 24.4 22.8 19.2 17.8 16.4 17.3 15.2 ## [15] 10.4 10.4 14.7 32.4 30.4 33.9 21.5 15.5 15.2 13.3 19.2 27.3 26.0 30.4 ## [29] 15.8 19.7 15.0 21.4 This $ syntax can not be applied to rows. Subsetting with [] syntax To subset multiple columns, or to subset specific rows, we need to use [row,column] style indexing (not the $). But we’re not forced to use numeric vectors just because we’re using the [ operator. We can select multiple columns by their names using a character vector that has the names of our desired columns as its elements. mtcars[,c(&quot;mpg&quot;,&quot;disp&quot;,&quot;gear&quot;)] # need as well as the quotes here ## mpg disp gear ## Mazda RX4 21.0 160.0 4 ## Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 160.0 4 ## Datsun 710 22.8 108.0 4 ## Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 258.0 3 ## Hornet Sportabout 18.7 360.0 3 ## [ reached getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 27 rows ] One of the most common subsetting tasks with a data frame (or matrix) is the need to select values in one column where the values in another column meet a certain criteria. For example, you might want to select all the values in the column holding reaction times where participants were incorrect. There are 2 syntactic approaches to this, both of which use relational operators and logical indexing. Method 1: Index the data frame itself We will use the [row,column] method to pick out the values of the count column in InsectSprays where spray A was used. First, we will build up a logical vector to index the correct rows by testing where the spray column has value ‘A’ InsectSprays$spray ## [1] A A A A A A A A A A A A B B B B B B B B B B B B C C C C C C ## [ reached getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 42 entries ] ## Levels: A B C D E F InsectSprays$spray==&quot;A&quot; ## [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE ## [12] TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [23] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ## [ reached getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 42 entries ] Next, we combine this with a character vector of the column names we’re interested in, and put it inside our [] brackets InsectSprays[InsectSprays$spray==&quot;A&quot;,&#39;count&#39;] ## [1] 10 7 20 14 14 12 10 23 17 20 14 13 If we leave the column vector out, this statement will return a data frame. Can you guess how many unique values will be in the spray column in this case? Method 2: Index a vector from the data frame Here, we will use the $ operator to subset the count column from the InsectSprays data frame. Then, index this vector with the logical vector resulting from a relational test InsectSprays$count[InsectSprays$spray==&quot;A&quot;] # Same result as before ## [1] 10 7 20 14 14 12 10 23 17 20 14 13 Errors when indexing by name If you try to subset a column of a data frame using the $ operator, but the name of the column doesn’t exist, R will return NULL InsectSprays$neeeeeeighhhhh ## NULL But, if you use the [row,column] style of indexing and ask for a column that doesn’t exist, you get a formal error. InsectSprays[, &#39;neeeeeeighhhhh&#39;] ## Error in `[.data.frame`(InsectSprays, , &quot;neeeeeeighhhhh&quot;): undefined columns selected Its also a common mistake to forget the quotes around names inside the [] brackets, which will throw an “object not found” error (unless the an object with the same name just happens to exist by coincidence, in which case you will probably get another type of error).

To make the data set available on your own computer, run the following code: install.packages(&#39;psych&#39;) library(psych) You should now be able to access the sat.act data set: summary(sat.act) ## gender education age ACT ## Min. :1.000 Min. :0.000 Min. :13.00 Min. : 3.00 ## 1st Qu.:1.000 1st Qu.:3.000 1st Qu.:19.00 1st Qu.:25.00 ## Median :2.000 Median :3.000 Median :22.00 Median :29.00 ## Mean :1.647 Mean :3.164 Mean :25.59 Mean :28.55 ## 3rd Qu.:2.000 3rd Qu.:4.000 3rd Qu.:29.00 3rd Qu.:32.00 ## Max. :2.000 Max. :5.000 Max. :65.00 Max. :36.00 ## ## SATV SATQ ## Min. :200.0 Min. :200.0 ## 1st Qu.:550.0 1st Qu.:530.0 ## Median :620.0 Median :620.0 ## Mean :612.2 Mean :610.2 ## 3rd Qu.:700.0 3rd Qu.:700.0 ## Max. :800.0 Max. :800.0 ## NA&#39;s :13 As you can see, this data set includes self-reported SAT and ACT scores along with demographic information from 700 respondents. It therefore contains both categorical and continuous variables that are appropriate for both within- and between-subjects analyses. For more information, refer to the help documentation by running the command ?sat.act. 3.2 Formula Objects Formulas are special objects in R that are used in a range of functions discussed in this chapter, notably plot(), aov(), and lm(). The use of formulas in these specific functions will be discussed in more detail below, but we first introduce their general properties here. The basic structure is as follows: y ~ x The y variable is the dependent variable, the x variable is the independent variable, and the ~ operator can be taken to mean “as a function of”. Thus, the above example is a formula for “y as a function of x”. For a more concrete example, consider the effect of the independent variable age on the dependent variable ACT scores: sat.act$ACT ~ sat.act$age We can have multiple independent variables in the formula. For instance, if we wanted to define ACT scores as a function of age and education, we would do so as follows: sat.act$ACT ~ sat.act$age + sat.act$education The above formula is an example of an “additive” model, in which ACT scores are a function of the additive effects of age and education. To define the interactive model, we would separate age and education by an asterisk instead of a plus sign: sat.act$ACT ~ sat.act$age*sat.act$education Note that the above formula defines the full interactive model, so ACT scores are defined as a function of (1) the main effect of age, (2) the main effect of education, and (3) the interaction of age and education. This same model can be implemented by defining each components separately in the formula object, like this: sat.act$ACT ~ sat.act$age + sat.act$education + sat.act$age:sat.act$education By defining the components separately, you can pick and choose which to keep. For instance, you could specify only the main effect of age and the interaction of age and education, as follows: sat.act$ACT ~ sat.act$age + sat.act$age:sat.act$education Formulas can get much more complex than the examples here, which only extend as far necessary for the functions and tests that you are likely to use as an instructor in undergraduate psychology program. A comprehensive tutorial can be found here. 3.3 Descriptive Statistics 3.3.1 Mean 3.3.2 Median 3.3.3 Variance 3.3.4 Standard Deviation 3.3.5 Standard Error 3.3.6 Correlation 3.3.7 Summary Functions 3.4 Plotting One of the most compelling reason to learn and use is because it includes highly flexible and powerful tools for visualizing many kinds of data. After all, if a single tool can perform your analyses and create your figures, why not use the “one ring to rule them all”? Many visualizations can be created using the plot() function, so we’ll begin our introduction using that function. As you’ll soon see, the plot() function accepts many arguments, as there are many ways to customize a plot. Many of the other visualization tools in R accept similar arguments. So, if plot() accepts an argument, there is a fair chance another function will accept it as well. 3.4.1 Scatter &amp; Line Plots If you have two vectors representing pairs of observations, you can plot them against one another in a scatter plot using the plot() function. Let’s demonstrate this by plotting the SAT Verbal and SAT Quantitative scores from the sat.act dataset against one another. plot(sat.act$SATV, sat.act$SATQ) # Access the columns as vectors using $ syntax The points in the plot above represent pairs SAT Verbal and SAT Quantitative scores. The scores in each vector are paired up by position within each vector - the first value in SATV is paired with the first value in SATQ, the second value in SATV is paired with the second value in SATQ, etc. The vector given as the first argument determines the X axis position, and the vector given as the second argument determines the Y axis position. The axis titles are determined by the variable names of the vectors supplied to the plot function. However, variable names aren’t always the most informative names for other humans to read. We can customize the axes and plot with informative titles using the xlab, ylab and main arguments for the plot function: plot(sat.act$SATV, sat.act$SATQ, xlab = &quot;SAT Verbal&quot;, ylab = &quot;SAT Quantitative&quot;, main = &quot;Relationship between SAT Scores&quot;) 3.4.1.1 Linetypes, Symbols, and Colors You can customize the scatterplot to draw lines between the points, or just draw lines without the point symbols with the type argument. This is not a sensible thing to do for these data, but we demonstrate it anyway for completeness. # Lines and points plot(sat.act$SATV, sat.act$SATQ, xlab = &quot;SAT Verbal&quot;, ylab = &quot;SAT Quantitative&quot;, main = &quot;Relationship between SAT Scores&quot;, type = &quot;o&quot;) Figure 3.1: Points and lines with type=‘o’ # Just lines plot(sat.act$SATV, sat.act$SATQ, xlab = &quot;SAT Verbal&quot;, ylab = &quot;SAT Quantitative&quot;, main = &quot;Relationship between SAT Scores&quot;, type = &quot;l&quot;) Figure 3.2: Just using lines with type=‘l’ You can also customize the types of symbols that are used for each point using the pch, the style of lines connecting these points using the lty argument, and the col argument to adjust the color of lines and symbol borders With the pch argument, you specify the symbol used for each point using a numeric code. For example, the value 0 is the code for an unfilled square, while the value 15 is the value for a filled square with no border. Unfortunately, it has been scientifically proven that remembering the code for all the possible symbols is impossible. Luckily, a helpful mnemonic device called a “chart” has been invented to help R programmers customize their plots. This chart is shown below: Note that if you supply a character instead of a numeric values between 0 and 25, R will use that character as the plotting symbol. So, you could make a plot full of pound signs if you are so inclined! The lty argument has a bit more flexibility. Line types can either be specified as an integer (0=blank, 1=solid (default), 2=dashed, 3=dotted, 4=dotdash, 5=longdash, 6=twodash) or as one of the character strings “blank”, “solid”, “dashed”, “dotted”, “dotdash”, “longdash”, or “twodash”. The col argument accepts character string describing either a “built in” color name (see ?colors for a list) or an RGB triplet encoded in hexadecimal notation. Unless you are intimately familiar with RGB color space, it’s a good idea to use a tool like the W3 Organizations Online Color Picker to help you figure out the RGB hex code for the color you want. To demonstrate, lets take our original plot (with no lines) and customize it to use unfilled, magenta triangles: # Lines and points plot(sat.act$SATV, sat.act$SATQ, xlab = &quot;SAT Verbal&quot;, ylab = &quot;SAT Quantitative&quot;, main = &quot;Relationship between SAT Scores&quot;, col=&quot;magenta&quot;, pch=2) 3.4.1.2 Axis limits R usually does a good job of determining good values for the range of each axis, but if you wish to override the defaults, you can do do using the xlim and ylim arguments. These arguments accepts 2-element numeric vectors specifying the minimum and maximum values along each axis (in that order). For example, if we wanted to include 0 in the range of SAT scores shown on the plot, we could use c(0, 800) for both our axis limits: # Lines and points plot(sat.act$SATV, sat.act$SATQ, xlab = &quot;SAT Verbal&quot;, ylab = &quot;SAT Quantitative&quot;, main = &quot;Relationship between SAT Scores&quot;, xlim = c(0, 800), ylim=c(0, 800)) This isn’t particularly sensible, because 0 is not a possible score on the SAT, so consider this just a demonstration of R’s capabilities. 3.4.1.3 Adding to an existing plot In many cases, it is useful to have different symbols, colors, and linetypes on the same plot - for example, to denote observations from different groups. There is more than one way to achieve this effect, but when you want different symbols, colors, and linetypes on the same plot, often the easiest way to do it is plot each group one at a time. To do this, you begin with the familiar plot command, but use it to plot only a subset of the data. Then, you can use the points or lines function to add additional points (or lines) to the plot. We’ll demonstrate how you can plot the SAT scores for males and females in different colors by subsetting the dataset, and then using the plot and points functions: males &lt;- sat.act[sat.act$gender == 1, ] females &lt;- sat.act[sat.act$gender == 2, ] plot(males$SATV, males$SATQ, xlab = &quot;SAT Verbal&quot;, ylab = &quot;SAT Quantitative&quot;, main = &quot;Relationship between SAT Scores&quot;, col=&quot;red&quot;) points(females$SATV, females$SATQ, col=&quot;blue&quot;) 3.4.1.4 Adding a legend If you use multiple symbols, colors, and linetypes on the same plot, you’ll also need a legend telling the viewer how to interpret the different symbols, colors, and linetypes. You can add legends to an existing plot using the legend function. Unfortunately, the legend function doesn’t know what symbols, colors, and linetypes you’ve used, or what the different groups in your data are. So, you’ll have to re-capitulate this information to the legend function. Make absolutely sure that you specify the labels, colors, symbol codes, and linetypes in the exact same order you added them to the plot! You also must specify a pch or linetype value, even if you used the default value in your plot! Perhaps the trickiest part about using the legend function is figuring out where to place the legend. The location may also be specified by setting the first argument to the legend function to a single keyword from the set “bottomright”, “bottom”, “bottomleft”, “left”, “topleft”, “top”, “topright”, “right” or “center”. Alternatively, you can get fine-grained control over the placement by providing two values that represent an x,y coordinate for the top-right corner of the legend: plot(males$SATV, males$SATQ, xlab = &quot;SAT Verbal&quot;, ylab = &quot;SAT Quantitative&quot;, main = &quot;Relationship between SAT Scores&quot;, col=&quot;red&quot;) points(females$SATV, females$SATQ, col=&quot;blue&quot;) legend(x=200, y=800, legend = c(&quot;Males&quot;, &quot;Females&quot;), col = c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;), pch=1) 3.4.1.5 Adding a regression line It is often useful to summarize the linear relationship between variables shown in a scatterplot. It is easy to add the “line of best fit” from a linear regression to your scatter plot using the lm function (short for \"linear model) and the abline function (used for drawing straight lines). The lm function performs regression analysis based on the formula you specify. If you intended on adding the regression line to your scatterplot, we recommend you use the same formula to specify your plot, which the plot function is more than capable of understanding. The basic steps are: Perform your linear regression with lm, and save the output to a variable Create your scatterplot using the same formula specification Prove the lm object you saved in Step #1 to the abline function. Marvel at your wonderful new plot regression_results &lt;- lm(SATQ ~ SATV, data=sat.act) plot(SATQ ~ SATV, data=sat.act, xlab = &quot;SAT Verbal&quot;, ylab = &quot;SAT Quantitative&quot;, main = &quot;Relationship between SAT Scores&quot;) abline(regression_results, lwd=2) # lwd = &quot;line width&quot;, In the call to abline above, we have specified the lwd argument, short for “line width”, a.k.a. thickness. The default value is 1, and we have double the thickness here so the regression line stands out from the points more. 3.4.2 Histograms You can create a histogram showing the counts or proportion of values from a single variable using the hist function. The hist function works with a vector of numeric values, and breaks this vector up into a number of discrete bins. By default, the hist function decides what the boundary values of the bins should be, and how many bins should be used, by applying the Sturges algorithm. However, you can manually control where the boundaries are placed by providing a vector of boundary values, or by providing a single value specifying the number of bins that should be used. We demonstrate both techniques below in plotting a histogram of ACT scores: hist(sat.act$ACT, breaks = 30) hist(sat.act$ACT, breaks = seq(0, max(sat.act$ACT), by=2)) If you want proportions instead of counts, set the freq argument to false. You can also use the same xlab, ylab, and main arguments we used with plot to get more informative titles/ hist(sat.act$ACT, breaks = 30, freq=FALSE, main = &quot;Distribution of ACT Scores&quot;, xlab = &quot;ACT Score&quot;) 3.4.3 Boxplots Box plots are a good way to present the shape of distribution of samples from several groups, along with some summary statistics of each group. We can create these plots in R using the boxplot function. If your to-be-plotted data is in a data frame, the best way to instruct the boxplot function what variables should be plotted is using a formula. If they are not in a data frame, you can provide each to-be-plotted variable as a separate vector. Here, we’ll demonstrate the formula interface by plotting the SAT Verbal scores for respondents with education levels. Remember, when using the formula interface, you also have to tell the boxplot function what data frame to look for the variables in! boxplot(SATV ~ education, data=sat.act, names=c(&quot;&lt; High School&quot;, &quot;High School&quot;, &quot;Some College&quot;, &quot;2 Yr. College&quot;, &quot;4 Yr. College&quot;, &quot;Grad. Work&quot;), ylab=&quot;SAT Verbal Score&quot;, xlab=&quot;Education&quot;) Note the use of the names argument to override the labels on each X axis point. 3.4.4 Bar plots Bar plots are used to visualize single summary statistics, like the mean or median across groups. We can create a bar plot in R using the barplot function. We’ll demonstrate this by plotting the mean SAT Verbal score for males and females. The to-be-plotted value should be specified in a vector or matrix, with one element for each bar you want plotted SATV_means &lt;- c(mean(sat.act$SATV[sat.act$gender==1]), mean(sat.act$SATV[sat.act$gender==2]) ) names(SATV_means) &lt;- c(&quot;Males&quot;,&quot;Females&quot;) barplot(SATV_means, ylim=c(0,800), ylab=&quot;Average SAT Verbal Score&quot;, main=&quot;SAT Verbal Scores for Males &amp; Females&quot; ) 3.4.5 Multiple plots in single figure In many situations, it is useful to have several different plots in a single figure to facilitate comparison. But in the examples we have encountered so far, each time we create a new plot, it has removed the existing one from out figure window. We can change this behavior to allow multiple figures within the same window by using the par function, which changes R’s global graphics parameters. We can set the number of plots that go into a figure window much in the same way we set the dimensions of a matrix - by specifying how many rows of plots there can be, and how many columns of plots there can be. The product of these two values determines the number of plots that are put on a single figure window. There are two global graphics parameters that allow us to set these dimensions - the mfrow parameter, and the mfcol parameter. The mf stands for “multiple figures”, and the row or col part means the figures are filled in by rows, or by columns. Here, we demonstrate how to use the mfrow option to create a 2 by 2 grid of plots, which will allow us to compare the distribution of ACT scores in histograms with different numbers of breaks: par(mfrow = c(2,2)) hist(sat.act$ACT, breaks = 10, main = &quot;10 breaks&quot;) hist(sat.act$ACT, breaks = 30, main = &quot;30 breaks&quot;) hist(sat.act$ACT, breaks = 50, main = &quot;50 breaks&quot;) hist(sat.act$ACT, breaks = 100, main = &quot;100 breaks&quot;) par(mfrow = c(1,1)) # Reset back to default Always make sure to set your mfrow or mfcol values back to c(1,1) afterwards, or all subsequent plots will use the same layout! 3.4.6 Saving Plots Usually the purpose of creating a visualization in R is to include it in some kind of homework, report, or paper. It is easy to save a plot made in R to an image file on your hard drive using the “Export” option in the R Studio plot pane. Simply click the “Export” drop down menu, and select either the “Save to Image”, “Save to PDF” or “Copy to Clipboard” options. If you choose the “Save as Image” option, you’ll get to choose which image format you want to save it as, and what the width and height (in pixels) the image should be saved as. 3.4.7 What about ggplot? The ggplot2 package is an extremely popular visualization tool, which provides an alternative to the so-called “base graphics” functions described here. The popularity ggplot has achieved is well deserved - it’s visualizations are attractive, and it’s data-driven, modular coding style is very powerful. The programming style of ggplot is very different from the base graphics style. Perhaps the best way to summarize the ggplot approach is that it is builds on top of the organization of the observations inside a data frame and allows you to “map” the variables in your data frame to the “aesthetics” in a plot (shape, position, color, size, etc.). We will not cover ggplot here, because it is not a necessity for 240 and 241 (though, in our opinion, a proficient R programmer should know how both ggplot and base graphics). However, we will re-iterate the advice the ggplot package authors give for those wishing to learn how to use ggplot: If you are new to ggplot2 you are better off starting with a systematic introduction, rather than trying to learn from reading individual documentation pages. Currently, there are three good places to start: The data visualisation and graphics for communication chapters in R for data science. If you’d like to take an interactive online course, try Data visualisation with ggplot2 by Rick Scavetta on DataCamp. If you want to dive into making common graphics as quickly as possible, I recommend The R Graphics Cookbook by Winston Chang. 3.5 Inferential Statistics 3.5.1 Distribution Functions The sections below introduce functions for executing common statistical tests. However, R’s family of distribution functions also make it possible to explore the underlying probability distributions for each test, and to carry out each test by hand. We therefore begin our demonstration of inferential statistics by giving an overview of these powerful instructional tools. The full list of available distributions can be found here. The following table provides an overview the distributions that are likely to be relevant to you as an instructor, including the suffix that each distribution is identified by in the functions below: Distribution Suffix Parameters Normal norm mean, SD Student’s T t df, non-centrality Chi-Square chisq df, non-centrality (non-negative) F f df1, df2, non-centrality Binomial binom size (number of observations), probability Uniform unif minimum, maximum View the help documentation for default parameter values and additional details. Each distribution can be accessed by a set of four functions, each labelled with the distribution’s suffix and a task-specific prefix: Prefix Task Example d Get the probability density associated with a point on the x-axis. dnorm() p Get the probability of a value above or below a point on the x-axis. pnorm() q Get the x-axis value marking a cumulative probability. qnorm() r Get a random sample from the distribution. rnorm() These functions are each demonstrated in the following sub-sections using the normal distribution. In these examples, consider that IQ scores are meant to be normally distributed with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15: 3.5.1.1 Getting Densities The functions for getting the probability density associated with a point on the x-axis, such as dnorm() in the case of the normal distribution, are unlikely to come up in class. However, they may be useful for generating figures such as the one above, which was created with the following code: hist(rnorm(10000, mean=100, sd=15), freq=FALSE, ylim=c(0, .03), xlab=&#39;&#39;, main=&#39;IQ Scores&#39;) points(x=seq(40, 160, .001), y=dnorm(seq(40, 160, .001), mean=100, sd=15), type=&#39;l&#39;, col=&#39;red&#39;) Note that the input to dnorm() was a sequence of values from 40 to 160, by steps of .001. The output was the probability density for each value in the sequence. These values were then used to create a continuous curve that was added to the histogram of the data, in which the argument freq=FALSE ensured that the y-axis denoted probability densities instead of counts. A more detailed tutorial is provided here. 3.5.1.2 Getting Probabilities You can use pnorm() to demonstrate that there is a 9.12% chance of getting an IQ score that is less than or equal to 80: pnorm(80, mean=100, sd=15) ## [1] 0.09121122 To find the probability of getting a value greater than or equal to a cutoff, such as 80, you can either add the argument lower.tail=FALSE: pnorm(80, mean=100, sd=15, lower.tail=FALSE) ## [1] 0.9087888 …or, since the area under the curve sums to 1, you can subtract the output of the previous command from 1: 1-pnorm(80, mean=100, sd=15) ## [1] 0.9087888 The latter method may be better for instructional purposes. 3.5.1.3 Getting Quantiles You can use qnorm() to demonstrate that an IQ score of 124.67 marks the 95th percentile of scores: qnorm(.95, mean=100, sd=15) ## [1] 124.6728 Similarly, you can add the argument lower.tail=FALSE to see the point on the x-axis that marks the top 95% of scores: qnorm(.95, mean=100, sd=15, lower.tail=FALSE) ## [1] 75.3272 Note that subtracting from 1 does not work here as it did with pnorm() because the output of qnorm() is a quantile, which does not need to sum to 1 as probabilities do. 3.5.1.4 Getting Random Samples You can use rnorm() to randomly sample a class of 50 students from the population of IQ scores: rnorm(50, mean=100, sd=15) ## [1] 88.34978 94.59001 76.77104 83.83402 94.81948 85.26418 98.05681 ## [8] 124.20045 103.68120 99.39780 81.10266 101.82454 115.94468 96.81382 ## [15] 96.65950 114.85277 106.01546 76.75924 110.58895 94.92199 99.45198 ## [22] 105.72418 114.08677 98.20056 108.21798 95.06323 100.69525 116.84644 ## [29] 118.88588 85.38621 121.39220 101.14632 119.12717 119.57454 102.38109 ## [36] 92.87468 88.73590 83.21046 101.53561 91.93236 106.91743 120.00010 ## [43] 124.49441 114.39422 111.85415 89.28847 87.75988 130.26767 82.50233 ## [50] 115.45107 3.5.1.5 Running Statistical Tests by Hand These functions can be used to conduct statistical analyses by hand. Consider a demonstration of a z-test using the functions for the normal distribution. To test whether an IQ score of 135 is significantly different from the mean IQ score, first find the z-score: IQ135_z &lt;- (135-100)/15 IQ135_z ## [1] 2.333333 You could then compare that z-score to the critical z-scores associated with an alpha of .05, here assuming a two-tailed hypothesis: qnorm(.025) ## [1] -1.959964 qnorm(.975) ## [1] 1.959964 The z-score of an IQ of 135 is greater than the critical z-score for the upper tail, so we can reject the null hypothesis. Note that for a one-tailed hypothesis, simply use one call to qnorm() with .05 or .95 for the lower or upper tail, respectively. Alternatively, you could find the probability of getting a z-score that if equal to the test score or more extreme (in this case, more positive), and compare that to the alpha value instead of the critical z-score: IQ135_z_prob &lt;- 1-pnorm(IQ135_z) The probability of getting an IQ of 135 is less than alpha (either .025 for a two-tailed hypothesis or .05 for a one-tailed hypothesis), so we reject the null hypothesis. Note that you could also apply this method by finding the probability of an IQ of 135 given a mean of 100 and standard deviation of 15, and compare that to the alpha value instead: IQ135_prob &lt;- 1-pnorm(135, mean=100, sd=15) This provides the same probability as for the z-score, so we make the same conclusion. However, though it uses one line of code instead of two, you may find that this method is more confusing for some students, particularly if they are used to seeing distributions centered on 0 elsewhere in the course. This same process can be extended to a range of statistical tests, including t tests, F tests, Chi-Square tests, and binomial tests. 3.5.2 t.test() The t.test() function can be used to execute one-sample, paired, or two-sample t-tests. Each case is demonstrated below, but first note three general arguments that can be used to augment the test: Argument Values alternative Set to two.sided for a two-sided test, less for the lower tail, and greater for the upper tail; the default is two.sided. var.equal Set to TRUE to assume equal variance and FALSE otherwise; the default is FALSE. conf.level Provide a number between 0 and 1 to specify the range for the confidence interval; the default is .95. 3.5.2.1 One-sample t-tests To demonstrate a one-sample t-test, imagine that we are curious whether the average verbal SAT score in the sat.act data set is different from 0. We could test that question with the following call: t.test(sat.act$SATV) ## ## One Sample t-test ## ## data: sat.act$SATV ## t = 143.47, df = 699, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 603.8560 620.6126 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x ## 612.2343 The output of t.test() gives us a nice summary of the results, including the t-statistic, degrees of freedom, p-value, and 95% confidence interval. The p-value is essentially 0, so we can reject the null hypothesis that the average verbal SAT score is 0. If we wanted to instead see if the average verbal SAT score was different from 650, we could change the null comparison value by setting the mu parameter: t.test(sat.act$SATV, mu=600) ## ## One Sample t-test ## ## data: sat.act$SATV ## t = 2.867, df = 699, p-value = 0.004269 ## alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 600 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 603.8560 620.6126 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x ## 612.2343 The p-value is 0.004, so we can reject the null hypothesis that the average verbal SAT score is 600. Instead, it appears to be significantly higher. 3.5.2.2 Paired t-tests To demonstrate a paired t-test, imagine that we are curious as to whether verbal SAT scores are different from quantitative SAT scores. We can conduct this in one of two ways. First, we could calculate the difference score for each pair, then run a one-sample t-test comparing the average difference score to 0: # Calculate difference scores sat.act$SAT_diff &lt;- sat.act$SATV-sat.act$SATQ # Run a one-sample t-test t.test(sat.act$SAT_diff) ## ## One Sample t-test ## ## data: sat.act$SAT_diff ## t = 0.57483, df = 686, p-value = 0.5656 ## alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -5.116109 9.351917 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x ## 2.117904 The p-value is .566, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the difference between verbal and quantitative SAT scores are approximately zero. In the second method, we could have t.test() compute the difference scores for us by specifying both samples and setting the paired argument to TRUE: t.test(sat.act$SATV, sat.act$SATQ, paired=TRUE) ## ## Paired t-test ## ## data: sat.act$SATV and sat.act$SATQ ## t = 0.57483, df = 686, p-value = 0.5656 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -5.116109 9.351917 ## sample estimates: ## mean of the differences ## 2.117904 We get exactly the same result. However, note that though this method uses fewer lines of code it risks obscuring the role of difference scores for the student. 3.5.2.3 Two-sample t-tests To demonstrate a two-sample t-test, imagine that we are curious as to whether male and female students reported different quantitative SAT scores. The function call is very similar to the second method for conducting a paired t-test, but we set the paired argument to FALSE instead: t.test(sat.act$SATQ[sat.act$gender==1], sat.act$SATQ[sat.act$gender==2], paired=FALSE) ## ## Welch Two Sample t-test ## ## data: sat.act$SATQ[sat.act$gender == 1] and sat.act$SATQ[sat.act$gender == 2] ## t = 4.3544, df = 492.94, p-value = 1.624e-05 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 21.88433 57.87165 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x mean of y ## 635.8735 595.9955 The p-value is approximately .00002, so we can reject the null hypothesis that male and female students report essentially the same quantitative SAT scores. Instead, the mean score for males appears to be significantly higher. Note that the default value for the paired argument is FALSE, so running the above call with the paired argument omitted would produce the same result. However, you might want to encourage students to always specify the argument for a t-test with two samples so that they can be sure they are running the intended test. Further, note that the above example indexes the male and female groups within the call to t.test(), but you could also ask students to do this separately beforehand: # Subset the groups male_SATQ &lt;- sat.act$SATQ[sat.act$gender==1] female_SATQ &lt;- sat.act$SATQ[sat.act$gender==2] # Run a two-sample t-test t.test(male_SATQ, female_SATQ, paired=FALSE) ## ## Welch Two Sample t-test ## ## data: male_SATQ and female_SATQ ## t = 4.3544, df = 492.94, p-value = 1.624e-05 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 21.88433 57.87165 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x mean of y ## 635.8735 595.9955 3.5.3 aov() The aov() command can be used to execute an ANOVA. The basic call includes one argument, which is a formula object. Whether aov() is used to run a one-way, two-way, or multi-way ANOVA, with or without interaction terms, is based entirely on the formula. 3.5.3.1 One-way ANOVA To demonstrate a one-way ANOVA, imagine that we are curious as to whether verbal SAT scores vary across education level: aov(sat.act$SATV ~ sat.act$education) ## Call: ## aov(formula = sat.act$SATV ~ sat.act$education) ## ## Terms: ## sat.act$education Residuals ## Sum of Squares 19247 8890899 ## Deg. of Freedom 1 698 ## ## Residual standard error: 112.8613 ## Estimated effects may be unbalanced The standard output of aov does not contain readily interpretable results. To get the ANOVA table, it is better to save the output of aov(), then call summary() on that saved object: educ_aov &lt;- aov(sat.act$SATV ~ sat.act$education) summary(educ_aov) ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## sat.act$education 1 19247 19247 1.511 0.219 ## Residuals 698 8890899 12738 Now we can see that the p-value is greater than an alpha of .05, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis that verbal SAT scores are equal across levels of education. We might neaten up our code a bit by using the data argument to specify the data frame that our variables belong to. This allows us to just use the column names in the formula object: educ_aov &lt;- aov(SATV ~ education, data=sat.act) summary(educ_aov) ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## education 1 19247 19247 1.511 0.219 ## Residuals 698 8890899 12738 3.5.3.2 Two-way ANOVA To demonstrate a two-way ANOVA, imagine that we are curious as to whether quantitative SAT scores vary across levels of education and gender: educ_gender_aov &lt;- aov(SATQ ~ education + gender, data=sat.act) summary(educ_gender_aov) ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## education 1 10998 10998 0.845 0.358 ## gender 1 261978 261978 20.133 8.47e-06 *** ## Residuals 684 8900522 13012 ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 ## 13 observations deleted due to missingness The p-value for education is .358, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis that quantitative SAT scores are equal across levels of education. The p-value for gender, however, is approximately zero, so we can reject the null hypothesis that quantitative SAT scores are equal across genders. To determine which gender has the highest scores, you might have your students find the means or create a barplot. The two-way ANOVA that we just ran assumed an additive model, but perhaps we think that the effect of gender on quantitative SAT scores is different across different levels of education. To test this hypothesis with the interactive model, change the + symbol between the independent variables to an *: educ_gender_aov_int &lt;- aov(SATQ ~ education * gender, data=sat.act) summary(educ_gender_aov_int) ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## education 1 10998 10998 0.844 0.358 ## gender 1 261978 261978 20.111 8.57e-06 *** ## education:gender 1 3396 3396 0.261 0.610 ## Residuals 683 8897126 13027 ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 ## 13 observations deleted due to missingness The p-value for the interaction term is .610, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the effect of gender on quantitative SAT scores is the same across levels of education. 3.5.4 cor.test() 3.5.5 binom.test() 3.5.6 chisq.test() 3.5.7 lm() 3.5.8 Confidence Intervals "],
["tools-advice-for-instructors.html", "Chapter 4 Tools &amp; Advice for Instructors 4.1 Best Practices 4.2 Error Messages 4.3 Data Sets", " Chapter 4 Tools &amp; Advice for Instructors 4.1 Best Practices 4.1.1 Commands vs. Buttons Though we strongly encourage you to use R through R Studio, we also encourage you and your students to rely on commands instead of button presses where possible. For instance, it is possible to save plots by exporting them from the Plots pane in R Studio, but it is also possible to save them with commands such as pdf() or png(). There are several benefits to prioritizing commands over button presses. First, it has the practical effect of reinforcing a command-line approach to programming your analyses, which may be new for you and is very likely new for your students. Second, and perhaps more importantly, it encourages reproduceability. If your students document all of the actions that they took in completing an assignment by having a command for each one, it will be easier for you to make sure that they did everything on their own, correct their habits where needed, and find the source of an error. It will also help you to reproduce your own work from semester to semester if your assignments are coded in R. 4.1.2 Naming Objects There are relatively few constraints to naming objects in R compared to other statistical software packages. We make several recommendations here for good naming practices. The “naming conventions” of a particular programming language refer to the formatting guidelines for object names. There are no agreed-upon naming conventions in R, but a good overview can be found here. In general, the best advice is to pick a convention that appeals to you and use it consistently. We recommend the “underscore_separated” scheme. Because period separation can sometimes refer to a different process in R, we do not recommend using the “period.separated” scheme. Regardless of the convention, it is also important to choose object names that are informative. That is, someone with little knowledge of the script, including some future version of yourself, should be able to get a general idea of what data an object contains based on the name. For instance, simply naming all versions of a data frame data, data_2, data_3, etc., is not informative because it is unclear what changes have been made between versions. 4.1.3 Scripting More than just a collection of commands, the script is an excellent tool for both both reproduceability and documentation of an analysis. It is therefore worthwhile to teach students good habits for writing scripts. First and foremost, scripts should include all of the commands that you need to conduct an analysis, and none of the commands that you don’t. That is, you should be able to run all of the lines in a script in order and get the same result each time (with the obvious exception of things like drawing random samples). To that end, all the commands necessary for an analysis should be in the proper sequence, and dny commands that are not necessary for the analysis but kept for posterity should be “commented out” by adding the # symbol at the start of the line. Second, scripts should be well-documented. Recall that you can add comments to any line by preceding the comment with the # symbol. Comments are an efficient way to explain to someone unfamiliar with the script what the intention is for each section of code. Ample documentation is not only a good programming habit to teach your students, it will also likely be very useful in helping you decipher their code. 4.1.4 Formatting Requirements for Assignments We encourage you to give your students clear formatting guidelines for assignments that require a significant amount of R programming to complete. The specific requirements that you decide on should be based on (1) the extent to which you want them to leave the class with generalizeable programming skills, and (2) the amount of detail that you would like from your students in terms of their code. Asking students to print the contents of their console will allow you to see all of the commands that they ran, the order in which they ran them, as well as the output and any error messages, but it will be quite a lot of information for you to sort through yourself. At the other extreme, asking for only the formatted results in a Word document makes it difficult to judge the quality of their code, which may be a primary goal of the assignment. A nice compromise is to ask for an electronic version of their script with all the necessary commands so that you can reproduce their results. This can either act as the main document or as a supplement to a formatted report. It has also become increasingly popular for instructors to provide students with prepared R Markdown (.Rmd) files with fill-in-the-blank style prompts for students to enter their code. This produces a nicely formatted document with their code and output, which may be easier for you administratively. However, this can also obscure the coding process for students and limit their independence. For this reason, we recommend against using prepared R Markdown files, and encourage you to teach students how to create and maintain their own scripts instead. 4.2 Error Messages All messages printed to the console in red text are meant to get your attention, but they differ in urgency. A message with Error printed at the beginning means that there was a problem that prevented the command from being evaluated, and you will not be able to run that command until you fix the problem. A message with Warning printed at the beginning means that the command was evaluated, but it might not have worked the way you intended, or R might have made some decision for you in order to execute the command. All other messages can generally be taken as updates on the status of your command. If you receive an error message that is unclear, the best way to determine the cause is to Google it. A list of the most common errors is provided here for convenience. 4.2.1 There is no output from a command, and there is a + in the console instead of a &gt;. The user has not completed the command, most likely by forgetting to close a quotation (or being inconsistent with the use of single vs. double quotations) or a set of parentheses. You can either add the end quotation or parenthesis if it is the final character, or press the escape button and start again. 4.2.2 Error: unexpected ')' in '___' The user has included one too many end parentheses. 4.2.3 Error: Object '___' not found The user has tried to call an object that is not in the environment. This may be because there is a typo in the name of the object, or because the object was never assigned to a label with the &lt;- operator. 4.2.4 Error in ___ : non-numeric argument to binary operator The user is most likely trying to conduct a mathematical operation on data that is of a non-numeric class, such as character or factor. If the data should be numeric, try overwriting it with as.numeric(). 4.2.5 Error in ___(x) : could not find function '___' The user is attempting to use a function that is not currently available in R, either because there is a typo in the name of the function or because the function’s package has not been loaded in this session. 4.2.6 Error in ___ : cannot open the connection The user is attempting to read or write a file at a location on the hard drive that does not exist, likely due to a typo in the file path or file name. 4.2.7 Error in ___ : undefined columns selected** or **Error in ___: subscript out of bounds The user is attempting to index an area of an object that does not exist, for instance, the ninth column of a seven-column data frame. 4.2.8 Error: unexpected symbol in '___' R cannot interpret part of the command, likely because the user has forgotten a comma between function arguments. 4.3 Data Sets This section includes an overview of useful data sets for in-class demonstrations or assignments. The first section includes data sets that are “built-in” as part of the base R datasets package, whereas the remaining sections review data sets from other packages that need to be installed. Note that each package has many more data sets than those we have chosen to highlight here. To see all of the data sets available to you at any given time, including those are built-in with base R or part of loaded packages, enter the following command: data() You should see a list of all the available data sets with a brief summary of each, separated by the package they belong to. 4.3.1 Built-In There are several small data sets included in base R that are useful for quick demos.

To demonstrate how to simulate a numeric variable, the following code simulates income for 1,000 families from a population in which income is normally distributed around $50,000 with a standard deviation of $5,000: sim_income &lt;- rnorm(n=1000, mean=50000, sd=5000) hist(sim_income) To demonstrate how to simulate a categorical variable, the following code simulates grades for 50 students in a pass/fail course in which there is a 50% chance of passing in the population: sim_grades &lt;- rbinom(n=50, size=1, prob=.5) sim_grades &lt;- factor(sim_grades, levels=0:1, labels=c(&#39;FAIL&#39;, &#39;PASS&#39;)) barplot(table(sim_grades)) Other potentially useful “population” distributions include rbeta(), rbinom(), rchisq(), rexp(), rf(), rgamma(), rlogis(), rlnorm(), rpois(), rt(), and runif().
